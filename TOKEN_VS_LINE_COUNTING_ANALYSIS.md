# Token vs Line Counting Analysis

**Date**: 2025-10-28
**User Feedback**: "Shouldn't context size be estimated with words/tokens rather than lines?"

---

## TL;DR: User Was Right!

**Current approach (lines)**: Massively over-conservative and inaccurate
**Token-based approach**: 7-8% actual usage vs 30% budgeted

---

## The Problem with Line Counting

### CFR-018 Current Approach (Lines)
```
Budget: 30% of 1,600 lines = 480 lines
```

**Issues**:
1. **Variable line length**: 10 chars to 200 chars, all count as "1 line"
2. **Empty lines count**: Whitespace = same as code
3. **No correlation to LLM tokens**: Lines ≠ words ≠ tokens
4. **Over-conservative**: We thought we were using 26-30% budget

---

## Reality Check: Token-Based Measurement

### Actual Token Usage (Measured)

Using Anthropic's rule: **~4 characters per token**

| Agent | README | Largest Command | Total | % of 60K Budget |
|-------|--------|-----------------|-------|-----------------|
| Architect | 1,861 | 696 (adr) | 4,557 | **7.6%** ✅ |
| CodeDeveloper | 1,467 | 1,300 (finalize) | 4,767 | **7.9%** ✅ |
| CodeReviewer | 1,653 | 599 (security) | 4,252 | **7.1%** ✅ |
| ProjectManager | 1,840 | 722 (report) | 4,562 | **7.6%** ✅ |

**Includes**: Command + README + 2,000 (assumed auto-skills)

### Key Finding

**We are using 7-8% of budget, NOT 26-30%!**

This means:
- ✅ All commands well under budget
- ✅ Plenty of room for larger specs (up to 20K+ tokens)
- ✅ Could increase command sizes if needed
- ✅ Over-compression was unnecessary

## Why Tokens Matter

### Claude's Actual Context

```
Total Context: 200,000 tokens (NOT 1,600 lines!)

30% Budget: 60,000 tokens for infrastructure
70% Budget: 140,000 tokens for work content

Conversion:
- 1 token ≈ 4 characters ≈ 0.75 words
- 1,600 lines × 80 chars/line = 128,000 chars = 32,000 tokens
- Our "30% line budget" = 480 lines = 9,600 tokens = 4.8% actual!
```

### Token-Based Reality

**Infrastructure (Actual)**:
```
Command:      1,000-1,500 tokens (average)
Agent README: 1,500-2,000 tokens (180 lines)
Auto-skills:  2,000 tokens (estimated)
────────────────────────────────────────
Total:        4,500-5,500 tokens (7-9% of context) ✅
```

**Work Content (Available)**:
```
Remaining:    ~195,000 tokens available
Spec:         6,000-8,000 tokens (320 lines × 25 tokens/line)
Code:         4,000-6,000 tokens
System:       5,000-8,000 tokens
────────────────────────────────────────
Total work:   ~20,000 tokens (10% of context)
Still free:   ~175,000 tokens (87.5%!)
```

## Conversion Table

| Measurement | Our Commands | Budget (30%) | % Used |
|-------------|--------------|--------------|--------|
| **Lines** (old) | 180 + 120 = 300 | 480 lines | 62% |
| **Characters** | ~18,000 chars | ~38,400 chars | 47% |
| **Tokens** (real) | ~4,500 tokens | 60,000 tokens | **7.5%** |

The line-based approach made us think we were using 62% of budget.
**Reality**: We're using 7.5% of budget!

## Recommendations

### 1. Update CFR-018 with Token-Based Budgets ✅ PRIORITY

Replace line counting with token counting:

```python
# Old (inaccurate)
max_lines = 480

# New (accurate)
max_tokens = 60_000  # 30% of 200K context
```

### 2. Implement Runtime Token Tracking ✅ HIGH VALUE

**Benefits**:
- Measure actual usage from API responses
- Pre-execution validation
- Historical trend analysis
- Right-size budgets based on real data

**See**: `docs/RUNTIME_CONTEXT_VALIDATION.md` for full implementation plan

### 3. Use Provided Token Counter ✅

Module created: `coffee_maker/utils/token_counter.py`

```python
from coffee_maker.utils.token_counter import validate_command_file

# Validate a specific command
usage = validate_command_file("architect", "design")
print(usage)  # ✅ 4,486 tokens (7.5% of 60,000)

# Validate all commands
from coffee_maker.utils.token_counter import validate_all_commands
results = validate_all_commands()

# Generate report
from coffee_maker.utils.token_counter import generate_budget_report
print(generate_budget_report(results))
```

### 4. Relax Over-Compression

With 7.5% actual usage:
- **READMEs**: Could be 250-300 lines (currently 180)
- **Commands**: Could be 150-200 lines (currently 74-130)
- **Specs**: Could be 400-500 lines (currently 320)

**Recommendation**: Keep current sizes (they're clean and concise), but don't stress over 10-20 extra lines.

## Example: Actual vs Estimated

### architect.design Command

**Line-based estimate (old)**:
```
Command:  195 lines
README:   180 lines
Skills:   ~80 lines (estimated)
────────────────────
Total:    455 lines (95% of 480 line budget) ⚠️ "Near limit"
```

**Token-based reality (new)**:
```
Command:  625 tokens
README:   1,861 tokens
Skills:   2,000 tokens (estimated)
────────────────────
Total:    4,486 tokens (7.5% of 60K budget) ✅ "Plenty of room"
```

**Difference**: Thought we were at 95%, actually at 7.5%!

## User Questions Answered

### Q1: "Shouldn't context size be estimated with words rather than lines?"

**A**: Yes! Even better: use **tokens** (what Claude actually counts).

Accuracy ranking:
1. **Tokens** (best): Actual LLM measurement
2. **Words**: Good approximation (~0.75 words/token)
3. **Lines** (worst): No correlation to token count

### Q2: "Is it possible to measure at runtime the number of tokens we sent?"

**A**: Absolutely YES! Anthropic's API returns actual token usage:

```python
response = client.messages.create(...)

# Actual usage from API
input_tokens = response.usage.input_tokens
output_tokens = response.usage.output_tokens
total = input_tokens + output_tokens

# Compare to estimate
estimated = count_tokens(prompt)
accuracy = (estimated / input_tokens * 100)
```

**Implementation**: See `docs/RUNTIME_CONTEXT_VALIDATION.md`

## Conclusion

**User was 100% correct**:
1. ✅ Line counting is inaccurate
2. ✅ Token/word counting is much better
3. ✅ Runtime measurement is possible and valuable

**Impact**:
- We were **massively over-conservative** (7.5% actual vs 30% assumed)
- All our compression work is still valuable (clean, concise prompts)
- But we don't need to stress over every line
- Runtime tracking will give us real data for optimization

**Next Steps**:
1. Update CFR-018 with token-based budgets
2. Implement runtime token tracking
3. Collect real usage data for 1-2 weeks
4. Adjust budgets based on reality
