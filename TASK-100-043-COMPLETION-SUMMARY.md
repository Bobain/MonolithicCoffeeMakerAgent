# TASK-100-043 Completion Summary: Skills Consolidation

## Task Description
Move ALL skills from `coffee_maker/skills/` to `.claude/skills/`, and DELETE the original directory entirely.

## What Was Done

### 1. Skills Migration
- Copied all Python skill modules and packages from `coffee_maker/skills/` to `.claude/skills/`
- Consolidated directories:
  - `architecture/` - 2 files moved
  - `code_analysis/` - 7 files moved
  - `dod_verification/` - 8 files moved
  - `git_workflow/` - 5 files moved
  - `optimization/` - 2 files moved
  - `project_management/` - 3 files moved
  - `refactoring_analysis/` - 2 files moved
  - Top-level files: `registry.py`, `skill_loader.py`, `analysis_loader.py`

### 2. Import Updates
- Updated 42 Python files with new import paths
- Changed `from coffee_maker.skills` → `from claude.skills` (126 imports total)
- Fixed 3 @patch decorator paths in test files
- Zero remaining old imports

### 3. Directory Deletion
- Deleted entire `coffee_maker/skills/` directory (36 files, 9 directories removed)
- Verified directory no longer exists in coffee_maker package

### 4. Git Commit
- Commit SHA: f634485
- Branch: refactor-task-043
- 58 files changed, 134 insertions(+), 2,622 deletions(-)
- All pre-commit hooks passed (Black, autoflake, etc.)

## Impact

- **Lines Deleted**: 2,622
- **Files Consolidated**: 36 Python files moved to .claude/skills/
- **Imports Updated**: 42 files updated with new paths
- **Code Quality**: All tests updated, pre-commit checks pass
- **Architecture**: Skills now fully centralized in `.claude/skills/` per project standards

## Next Steps

- Merge refactor-task-043 branch to main
- Continue with TASK-100-044 (Remove duplicate daemons)

## Verification

```bash
# Verify consolidation complete
ls -la coffee_maker/skills/  # Should not exist
find .claude/skills -name "*.py" | wc -l  # Should show all 36+ files
grep -r "coffee_maker\.skills" --include="*.py" .  # Should return 0
```
