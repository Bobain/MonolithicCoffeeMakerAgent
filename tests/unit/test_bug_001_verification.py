BUG-001: Daemon stuck without --auto-approve flag
Fix: ProcessManager includes --auto-approve in start_daemon() command

These tests verify that:
1. ProcessManager.start_daemon() includes --auto-approve flag
2. Process detection requires --auto-approve flag
3. Daemon can make progress beyond iteration 2
