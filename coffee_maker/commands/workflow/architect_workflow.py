    """Ultra-consolidated workflow command for architectural design.

    Single command that handles complete design workflow:
        1. Load priority from roadmap
        2. Analyze requirements and dependencies
        3. Design solution architecture
        4. Create technical specification
        5. Document architectural decisions (ADR)
        6. Review and validate POC if needed
        7. Update dependency matrix
        8. Notify relevant agents

    Example:
        >>> workflow = ArchitectWorkflow()
        >>> spec_id = workflow.spec(priority_id="PRIORITY-5")
        >>> print(f"Created: {spec_id}")
