"""Generator Agent for ACE Framework - File Operation Interception and Ownership Enforcement.

This module implements the Generator agent from the ACE (Agentic Context Engineering) framework.
The Generator is responsible for:
1. Intercepting all file operations from agents
2. Enforcing file ownership rules (CFR-001)
3. Auto-delegating to correct owner when violations detected
4. Logging delegation traces for reflector analysis
5. Transparently returning results to requesting agent

Architecture:
    Generator: Main class that intercepts file operations
    DelegationTrace: Model for tracking delegations
    FileOperationType: Enum of interceptable operations

Integration with US-038:
    - Uses FileOwnership registry (Phase 1) for ownership checking
    - Provides Level 1 enforcement (automatic delegation)
    - Unblocks US-039 (comprehensive CFR enforcement)
    - Unblocks US-040 (project planner mode)

Usage:
    >>> from coffee_maker.autonomous.ace.generator import Generator
    >>> generator = Generator()
    >>>
    >>> # Intercept write operation
    >>> result = generator.intercept_file_operation(
    ...     agent_type=AgentType.PROJECT_MANAGER,
    ...     file_path=".claude/CLAUDE.md",
    ...     operation="write",
    ...     content="..."
    ... )
    >>> # Automatically delegated to code_developer (owner)
    >>> result.delegated_to == AgentType.CODE_DEVELOPER
    True

Key Features:
    - Automatic ownership enforcement (CFR-001)
    - Zero-configuration delegation (transparent to requesting agent)
    - Delegation trace logging (enables reflector analysis)
    - Read operations always allowed (no ownership check)
    - Write/edit/delete operations ownership-checked
    - Clear error messages for debugging
    - Thread-safe operation

    The Generator is a critical component of the ACE framework that sits between
