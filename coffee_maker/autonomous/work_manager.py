"""Work management for code_developer parallel execution.

This module enables code_developer to claim works from the database,
validate file access against assigned_files, and track work lifecycle.

Key Concepts:
- work: A unit of implementation work (e.g., "Phase 1 of PRIORITY 31")
- related_works_id: Groups sequential works (e.g., "GROUP-31" for 4 phases)
- priority_order: Enforces sequential execution within group (1, 2, 3, 4)

Author: code_developer
