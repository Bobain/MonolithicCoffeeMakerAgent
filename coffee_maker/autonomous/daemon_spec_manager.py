"""Technical Specification Management Mixin for DevDaemon.

This module provides technical specification creation and management functionality
for the autonomous development daemon, extracted from daemon.py to improve code
organization and maintainability.

US-045 UPDATE: Spec creation now delegates to architect agent instead of creating
specs directly. This follows proper ownership boundaries where architect owns
docs/architecture/specs/ directory.

Classes:
    SpecManagerMixin: Mixin providing _ensure_technical_spec() and architect delegation

Usage:
    class DevDaemon(SpecManagerMixin, ...):
        pass

Part of US-021 Phase 1 - Option D: Split Large Files

Enhanced with centralized prompt loading:
- Prompts stored in .claude/commands/ for multi-AI provider support
- Easy migration to Gemini, OpenAI, or other LLMs

US-045 Architecture:
- daemon delegates to architect via execute_prompt()
- architect creates specs in docs/architecture/specs/SPEC-XXX-name.md
- daemon verifies spec creation and proceeds with implementation

    This mixin provides methods for ensuring technical specifications exist

You are the code_developer daemon. You need a technical specification created for the following priority:

**Priority**: {priority_name}
**Title**: {priority_title}

**Details from ROADMAP.md**:
{priority_context}

**CRITICAL INSTRUCTION**: You MUST delegate this spec creation to the architect agent.

**Why delegate to architect?**
- architect owns docs/architecture/specs/ directory (per DOCUMENT_OWNERSHIP_MATRIX.md)
- You (code_developer) own implementation, NOT architectural design
- Proper separation of concerns: architect designs WHAT to build, you implement HOW

**What you need to do**:
1. Invoke the architect subagent using the Task tool
2. Request: "Create a technical specification for {priority_name}"
3. Provide the priority details above as context
4. architect will create: docs/architecture/specs/{spec_prefix}-<feature-name>.md

**Expected architect output**:
- Technical specification file in docs/architecture/specs/
- Filename pattern: {spec_prefix}-<descriptive-name>.md
- Contains: problem statement, architecture, components, testing strategy, rollout plan

**After architect creates the spec**:
- Verify the spec file exists in docs/architecture/specs/
- Report success/failure back to daemon

Please invoke the architect agent now to create the technical specification.
