"""Technical Specification Management Mixin for DevDaemon.

This module provides technical specification creation and management functionality
for the autonomous development daemon, extracted from daemon.py to improve code
organization and maintainability.

US-045 UPDATE: Spec creation now delegates to architect agent instead of creating
specs directly. This follows proper ownership boundaries where architect owns
docs/architecture/specs/ directory.

Classes:
    SpecManagerMixin: Mixin providing _ensure_technical_spec() and architect delegation

Usage:
    class DevDaemon(SpecManagerMixin, ...):
        pass

Part of US-021 Phase 1 - Option D: Split Large Files

Enhanced with centralized prompt loading:
- Prompts stored in .claude/commands/ for multi-AI provider support
- Easy migration to Gemini, OpenAI, or other LLMs

US-045 Architecture:
- daemon delegates to architect via execute_prompt()
- architect creates specs in docs/architecture/specs/SPEC-XXX-name.md
- daemon verifies spec creation and proceeds with implementation

    This mixin provides methods for ensuring technical specifications exist
    before implementing priorities, and creating them using Claude if missing.

    Required attributes (provided by DevDaemon):
        - self.roadmap_path: Path to ROADMAP.md
        - self.claude: ClaudeAPI instance
        - self.git: GitManager instance

    Methods:
        - _ensure_technical_spec(): Ensure spec exists or create it
        - _build_spec_creation_prompt(): Build prompt for creating specs

    Example:
        >>> class DevDaemon(SpecManagerMixin):
        ...     def __init__(self):
        ...         self.roadmap_path = Path("docs/roadmap/ROADMAP.md")

You are the code_developer daemon. You need a technical specification created for the following priority:

**Priority**: {priority_name}
**Title**: {priority_title}

**Details from ROADMAP.md**:
{priority_context}

**CRITICAL INSTRUCTION**: You MUST delegate this spec creation to the architect agent.

**Why delegate to architect?**
- architect owns docs/architecture/specs/ directory (per DOCUMENT_OWNERSHIP_MATRIX.md)
- You (code_developer) own implementation, NOT architectural design
- Proper separation of concerns: architect designs WHAT to build, you implement HOW

**What you need to do**:
1. Invoke the architect subagent using the Task tool
2. Request: "Create a technical specification for {priority_name}"
3. Provide the priority details above as context
4. architect will create: docs/architecture/specs/{spec_prefix}-<feature-name>.md

**Expected architect output**:
- Technical specification file in docs/architecture/specs/
- Filename pattern: {spec_prefix}-<descriptive-name>.md
- Contains: problem statement, architecture, components, testing strategy, rollout plan

**After architect creates the spec**:
- Verify the spec file exists in docs/architecture/specs/
- Report success/failure back to daemon

Please invoke the architect agent now to create the technical specification.
