"""Architect Coordinator for proactive spec creation.

This module coordinates the architect agent to maintain a backlog of 2-3 specs
ahead of code_developer, ensuring zero blocking waits for technical specifications.

Architecture:
    - Identifies priorities that need specs
    - Maintains spec backlog target (default: 3 specs ahead)
    - Tracks spec creation progress
    - Ensures CFR-011 compliance (architect reads code-searcher reports)
