2. **Error Messages** - Don't explain how to fix problems
3. **Progress Feedback** - Long operations lack intermediate feedback
4. **Visual Hierarchy** - Important info gets lost in comprehensive displays
5. **Inconsistent Formatting** - Different commands use different styles
6. **Missing Contextual Help** - No inline tips or suggestions
7. **Notification Management** - Tedious to respond to multiple items
8. **Setup Experience** - Configuration errors not well explained
