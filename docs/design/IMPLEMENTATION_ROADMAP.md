### Tasks

#### Task 1.1: Extend console_ui.py with Enhanced Functions
**Time**: 1 hour
**Owner**: code_developer
**Files**: `coffee_maker/cli/console_ui.py`

**Add Functions**:
```python
def error_block(
    title: str,
    message: str,
    suggestions: Optional[List[str]] = None,
    related_commands: Optional[List[Tuple[str, str]]] = None,
    details: Optional[str] = None
) -> None:
    """Display comprehensive error with suggestions."""

def warning_block(
    title: str,
    message: str,
    suggestions: Optional[List[str]] = None
) -> None:
    """Display warning with suggestions."""

def next_steps_hint(hints: List[Tuple[str, str]]) -> None:
    """Display helpful next steps with commands."""
    # Usage: next_steps_hint([
    #   ("project-manager respond 1 approve", "Approve first question"),
    #   ("project-manager view", "See updated roadmap")
    # ])

def status_item(
    label: str,
    value: str,
    emoji: Optional[str] = None,
    label_style: str = "bold cyan"
) -> None:
    """Display single status item."""
```

**Definition of Done**:
- [ ] Functions implemented in console_ui.py

```python
# BEFORE
if not ROADMAP_PATH.exists():
    print(f"❌ ROADMAP not found: {ROADMAP_PATH}")
    return 1

# AFTER

        message="Cannot find ROADMAP.md file",
        suggestions=[
            "Ensure you're on the roadmap branch: git checkout roadmap",
            "Verify file exists: ls -la ROADMAP.md",
            "Check your working directory: pwd"
        ],
        related_commands=[
            ("git status", "Check current git status"),
            ("git branch -a", "See all branches")
        ]
    )

    import json

    status = DeveloperStatus().read_status()
    if not status:
        console.print("[yellow]Daemon not running[/yellow]")
        return 1

    # Build one-liner
    state = status.get("status", "unknown")
    state_emoji = {
        "working": "🟢",
        "testing": "🟡",
        "blocked": "🔴",
        "idle": "⚪"
    }.get(state, "⚪")

    task = status.get("current_task", {})
    task_name = task.get("name", "Idle")
    progress = task.get("progress", 0)
    eta = task.get("eta_seconds", 0)
    eta_str = _format_duration(eta) if eta > 0 else "unknown"
    questions = len(status.get("questions", []))

    line = f"{state_emoji} {state.title()} | {task_name} ({progress}%, {eta_str}) | {questions} pending"

**Risk Level**: Low-Medium
- New commands (don't affect existing)
- New features (opt-in)
- Can be disabled if needed

### Stage 3: Phase 4-5 (Dashboard & Setup)
**Timeline**: Week 3
**Risk Level**: Medium
- More complex features
- Requires data consolidation
- Should be well-tested before rollout

### Phase 2: 2-3 hours
- Progress utilities: 1 hour
- Spec integration: 1-1.5 hours
- Help commands: 1 hour
- Testing: 0.5 hour

### Phase 3: 1-2 hours
- Notification display: 0.5 hour
- Batch response: 0.5-1 hour
- Testing: 0.5 hour

### Phase 4: 2-3 hours
- Dashboard implementation: 2-2.5 hours
- Integration with multiple sources: 0.5 hour

### Phase 5: 1-1.5 hours
