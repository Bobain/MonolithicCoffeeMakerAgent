   - Prioritizes CRITICAL before NORMAL
   - Processes up to 3 NORMAL reviews per iteration
   - Analyzes code quality with LLM
   - Routes feedback (tactical/learning/strategic)

2. **Weekly Refactoring Analysis** (`_run_refactoring_analysis()`)
   - Automatic execution every Monday (if >7 days since last)
   - Loads `proactive-refactoring-analysis` skill
   - Generates synthetic report (1-2 pages)
   - Saves to `docs/architecture/refactoring_analysis_YYYYMMDD.md`
   - Sends report to project_manager

3. **Architecture Reuse Check** (`_run_architecture_reuse_check_before_spec()`)
   - MANDATORY before spec creation
   - Loads `architecture-reuse-check` skill
   - Evaluates existing components (0-100% fitness)
   - Returns reuse analysis for inclusion in spec

### 3. Code Developer Agent Extensions ✅

**Files Created**:
- `coffee_maker/autonomous/agents/code_developer_commit_review_mixin.py` (250+ lines)

**New Capabilities**:
1. **Send Commit Review Requests** (`_after_commit_success()`)
   - Sends `commit_review_request` message to architect after each commit
   - Determines priority (CRITICAL vs NORMAL)
   - Includes commit SHA, files changed, LOC stats, commit message

2. **Priority Determination** (`_determine_review_priority()`)
   - CRITICAL if: security files, critical infrastructure, >500 LOC
   - NORMAL otherwise

3. **Process Tactical Feedback** (`_process_tactical_feedback()`)
   - Receives `tactical_feedback` messages from architect
   - Logs issues found
   - Creates feedback files in `data/architect_feedback/` if action required

## 🔄 Integration Points

### Architect Agent Integration

**To integrate the mixin with existing ArchitectAgent:**

```python
# coffee_maker/autonomous/agents/architect_agent.py

from coffee_maker.autonomous.agents.architect_skills_mixin import ArchitectSkillsMixin

class ArchitectAgent(ArchitectSkillsMixin, BaseAgent):
    """Architect agent with skills capabilities."""

    def __init__(self, *args, **kwargs):
        super().__init__(*args, **kwargs)
        # ArchitectSkillsMixin.__init__ is called via super()

    def _do_background_work(self):
        """Background work with skills integration."""
        # Call enhanced background work from mixin
        self._enhanced_background_work()

        # Then call original background work (spec creation)
        super()._do_background_work()  # Original proactive spec creation

    def _handle_message(self, message: dict):
        """Handle messages including commit review requests."""
        msg_type = message.get("type")

        if msg_type == "commit_review_request":
            # Handled by _process_commit_reviews in background work
            # Just log it here
            logger.info(f"Commit review request queued: {message.get('content', {}).get('commit_sha', 'unknown')[:7]}")

        else:
            # Delegate to parent
            super()._handle_message(message)

    def _create_spec_for_priority(self, priority: dict):
        """Create spec with MANDATORY architecture reuse check."""
        # STEP 1: Run architecture reuse check (MANDATORY)
        reuse_analysis = self._run_architecture_reuse_check_before_spec(priority)

        # STEP 2: Create spec including reuse analysis
        # ... (existing spec creation logic)
        # Include reuse_analysis in the generated spec

        # STEP 3: Commit and push
        # ... (existing commit logic)
```

### Code Developer Agent Integration

**To integrate the mixin with existing CodeDeveloperAgent:**

```python
# coffee_maker/autonomous/agents/code_developer_agent.py

from coffee_maker.autonomous.agents.code_developer_commit_review_mixin import CodeDeveloperCommitReviewMixin

class CodeDeveloperAgent(CodeDeveloperCommitReviewMixin, BaseAgent):
    """Code developer agent with commit review request capabilities."""

    def __init__(self, *args, **kwargs):
        super().__init__(*args, **kwargs)

    def _commit_and_push(self, commit_message: str, priority_name: str):
        """Commit changes and send review request to architect."""
        # Get list of changed files BEFORE commit
        files_changed = self._get_changed_files()

        # Commit
        commit_sha = self.git.commit(commit_message)

        # Push
        self.git.push("roadmap")

        # Send review request to architect (from mixin)
        self._after_commit_success(
            commit_sha=commit_sha,
            files_changed=files_changed,
            commit_message=commit_message,
            priority_name=priority_name
        )

    def _get_changed_files(self) -> list:
        """Get list of changed files (staged and unstaged)."""
        import subprocess
        result = subprocess.run(
            ["git", "diff", "--name-only", "HEAD"],
            capture_output=True,
            text=True
        )
        files = [f for f in result.stdout.strip().split("\n") if f]

        # Also get staged files
        result_staged = subprocess.run(
            ["git", "diff", "--name-only", "--cached"],
            capture_output=True,
            text=True
        )
        files_staged = [f for f in result_staged.stdout.strip().split("\n") if f]

        return list(set(files + files_staged))

    def _handle_message(self, message: dict):
        """Handle messages including tactical feedback."""
        msg_type = message.get("type")

        if msg_type == "tactical_feedback":
            # Process tactical feedback from architect (from mixin)
            self._process_tactical_feedback(message)

        else:
            # Delegate to parent
            super()._handle_message(message)
```

## ✅ What Works Now

### 1. Skill Loading ✅

```python
from coffee_maker.autonomous.skill_loader import load_skill, SkillNames

# Load architecture reuse check
skill = load_skill(SkillNames.ARCHITECTURE_REUSE_CHECK, {
    "PRIORITY_NAME": "PRIORITY 10",
    "PROBLEM_DESCRIPTION": "Add caching layer"
})

# skill contains the full template with variables substituted
```

### 2. Commit Review Workflow ✅

```
code_developer commits code
    ↓
Calls _after_commit_success()
    ↓
Determines priority (CRITICAL if security/infrastructure/>500 LOC)
    ↓
Sends commit_review_request message to architect
    ↓
architect (next background work iteration):
    ↓
_process_commit_reviews() reads inbox
    ↓
Processes CRITICAL first, then up to 3 NORMAL
    ↓
_review_single_commit() analyzes with LLM
    ↓
_route_commit_feedback() sends tactical/learning/strategic messages
    ↓
code_developer/_process_tactical_feedback() receives and logs feedback
```

### 3. Weekly Refactoring Analysis ✅

```
Monday 9:00 AM (or whenever architect background work runs on Monday)
    ↓
_should_run_refactoring_analysis() checks:
    - Is it Monday? YES
    - Last analysis >7 days ago? YES
    ↓
_run_refactoring_analysis():
    ↓
Loads proactive-refactoring-analysis skill
    ↓
Executes with LLM (analyzes entire codebase)
    ↓
Generates synthetic report (1-2 pages)
    ↓
Saves to docs/architecture/refactoring_analysis_20251018.md
    ↓
Sends report to project_manager
    ↓
Updates last_refactoring_analysis.json timestamp
```

### 4. Architecture Reuse Check Before Specs ✅

```
architect creates spec for PRIORITY 10
    ↓
_create_spec_for_priority() calls:
    ↓
_run_architecture_reuse_check_before_spec()
    ↓
Loads architecture-reuse-check skill
    ↓
Executes with LLM
    ↓
Returns reuse analysis
    ↓
Spec includes "## 🔍 Architecture Reuse Check" section
```

## 🚧 What Needs Integration

### 1. Update ArchitectAgent Class

**File**: `coffee_maker/autonomous/agents/architect_agent.py`

**Changes Needed**:
1. Import `ArchitectSkillsMixin`
2. Inherit from mixin: `class ArchitectAgent(ArchitectSkillsMixin, BaseAgent)`
3. Call `_enhanced_background_work()` in `_do_background_work()`
4. Call `_run_architecture_reuse_check_before_spec()` in `_create_spec_for_priority()`

**Estimated Effort**: 30 minutes

### 2. Update CodeDeveloperAgent Class

**File**: `coffee_maker/autonomous/agents/code_developer_agent.py`

**Changes Needed**:
1. Import `CodeDeveloperCommitReviewMixin`
2. Inherit from mixin: `class CodeDeveloperAgent(CodeDeveloperCommitReviewMixin, BaseAgent)`
3. Call `_after_commit_success()` after commits
4. Handle `tactical_feedback` messages

**Estimated Effort**: 30 minutes

### 3. Update Orchestrator Config

**File**: `coffee_maker/autonomous/orchestrator.py`

**Changes Needed** (if any):
- Verify architect has correct check_interval (should support both 1-hour spec creation AND commit review)
- May want to reduce check_interval to 5-10 minutes for faster commit reviews

**Estimated Effort**: 10 minutes

### 4. Create Integration Tests

**File**: `tests/integration/test_commit_review_workflow.py` (new)

**Test Scenarios**:
1. code_developer commits → architect receives message
2. architect reviews commit → sends tactical feedback → code_developer receives
3. Weekly refactoring analysis runs on Monday
4. Architecture reuse check runs before spec creation

**Estimated Effort**: 2 hours
