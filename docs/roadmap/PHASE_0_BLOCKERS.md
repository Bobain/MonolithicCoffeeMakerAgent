## Blocker Detection Criteria

### Automatic Detection (via phase-0-monitor skill)

#### 1. Stalled Work (>12 hours without progress)
**Trigger**:
- User story status = "in progress"
- No git commits for >12 hours
- No developer_status.json updates for >12 hours

**Action**:
- Create HIGH blocker ticket
- Notify user immediately
- Investigate: Agent stuck? Waiting on input? Complexity underestimated?

**Example**:
```
BLOCKER: US-091 stalled for 14 hours
Last commit: 2025-10-18 02:30 PST
Current time: 2025-10-18 16:30 PST
Status: No activity detected
Action Required: Check if code_developer needs assistance
```

---

#### 2. Test Failures (blocking commits)
**Trigger**:
- pytest exit code != 0
- Tests failing for >2 hours
- Same tests failing repeatedly

**Action**:
- Create CRITICAL blocker ticket (if >5 tests failing)
- Create HIGH blocker ticket (if 1-4 tests failing)
- Analyze failure patterns
- Suggest fixes

**Example**:
```
BLOCKER: 23 tests failing in test_daemon.py
First failure: 2025-10-18 14:00 PST
Root cause: ImportError in daemon_implementation.py
Suggested fix: Add missing import
Priority: CRITICAL (blocking all daemon work)
```

---

#### 3. Dependency Blocking
**Trigger**:
- User story A depends on user story B
- User story B incomplete
- Attempt to start user story A detected

**Action**:
- Create MEDIUM blocker ticket
- Prevent work on user story A
- Suggest alternative work
- Monitor user story B progress

**Example**:
```
BLOCKER: US-092 blocked by incomplete US-091
US-092 requires: Code Index infrastructure (US-091)
US-091 status: In progress (60% complete)
Estimated unblock: 2025-10-20 (2 days)
Alternative work: Continue US-090 testing, start US-062
```

---

#### 4. CFR-007 Violations (context budget exceeded)
**Trigger**:
- Agent startup materials >30% of context window
- Context budget check fails
- Agent initialization slow (>5s)

**Action**:
- Create MEDIUM blocker ticket
- Analyze what's consuming context
- Suggest remediation (lazy loading, skill extraction)
- Track violations over time

**Example**:
```
BLOCKER: code_developer startup exceeds CFR-007 limit
Context budget: 45% (target: <30%)
Root cause: Loading all daemon mixins at startup
Suggested fix: Implement US-062 (startup skills with lazy loading)
Priority: MEDIUM (doesn't block current work, but violates CFR)
```

---

#### 5. Merge Conflicts
**Trigger**:
- Git merge/pull fails
- Conflicts detected in critical files
- Multiple agents modifying same file

**Action**:
- Create HIGH blocker ticket (if critical files)
- Create MEDIUM blocker ticket (if non-critical files)
- Identify conflicting agents
- Coordinate resolution

**Example**:
```
BLOCKER: Merge conflict in daemon_implementation.py
Conflict between: code_developer (US-091) and architect (review)
Files affected: daemon_implementation.py (37 conflicts)
Resolution: code_developer resolves conflicts, architect re-reviews
Priority: HIGH (blocking both agents)
```

---

### Manual Detection (User or Agent Reports)

#### 1. User Reports Blocker
**Process**:
1. User submits blocker via `poetry run project-manager report-blocker`
2. project_manager creates blocker ticket
3. Assigns severity based on user input
4. Notifies relevant agents
5. Tracks resolution

#### 2. Agent Reports Blocker
**Process**:
1. Agent calls `warn_user()` with blocker details
2. project_manager creates blocker ticket automatically
3. Links to user story and agent
4. Escalates if CRITICAL/HIGH

---

## Blocker Resolution Protocol

### Step 1: Identify Blocker
- Automated detection via phase-0-monitor skill
- Manual report from user or agent
- Blocker ticket created in this file

### Step 2: Classify Severity
- CRITICAL: Stops ALL progress (resolve <4 hours)
- HIGH: Stops specific work stream (resolve <12 hours)
- MEDIUM: Slows progress (resolve <24 hours)
- LOW: Minimal impact (resolve <1 week)

### Step 3: Investigate Root Cause
- What caused the blocker?
- Is it technical (code issue, dependency, test failure)?
- Is it process (waiting on approval, missing information)?
- Is it coordination (multiple agents conflicting)?

### Step 4: Propose Resolution
- Immediate fix (if obvious)
- Escalate to architect (if design decision needed)
- Escalate to user (if approval needed)
- Workaround (if fix will take time)

### Step 5: Implement Resolution
- Apply fix
- Verify blocker resolved
- Update blocker ticket
- Document lessons learned

### Step 6: Prevent Recurrence
- Add automated check (if applicable)
- Update process (if process issue)
- Add to documentation (if knowledge gap)

## Escalation Paths

### CRITICAL Blocker Escalation
1. **Immediate**: project_manager creates blocker ticket
2. **<1 hour**: Notify user via warn_user()
3. **<2 hours**: Notify all relevant agents
4. **<4 hours**: If unresolved, architect investigates
5. **<8 hours**: If still unresolved, user intervention required

### HIGH Blocker Escalation
1. **Immediate**: project_manager creates blocker ticket
2. **<4 hours**: Notify affected agents
3. **<8 hours**: Notify user if still unresolved
4. **<12 hours**: architect investigates if needed

### MEDIUM Blocker Escalation
1. **Immediate**: project_manager creates blocker ticket
2. **<12 hours**: Monitor progress
3. **<24 hours**: Notify user if still unresolved

### LOW Blocker Escalation
1. **Immediate**: project_manager creates blocker ticket
2. **<1 week**: Monitor progress
3. **<2 weeks**: Close or re-classify if not resolved

## Common Blockers & Solutions

### Blocker Type 1: Test Failures
**Common Causes**:
- Missing imports
- Incorrect mocking
- Environment setup issues
- Breaking changes in dependencies

**Solutions**:
- Use test-failure-analysis skill (when US-065 complete)
- Check recent commits for breaking changes
- Verify environment (poetry install, database migrations)
- Run tests locally to reproduce

---

### Blocker Type 2: Dependency Issues
**Common Causes**:
- poetry.lock conflicts
- Incompatible versions
- Missing system dependencies
- Network issues (package download failures)

**Solutions**:
- Use dependency-conflict-resolver skill (when available)
- poetry lock --no-update
- Check pyproject.toml for version constraints
- Consult architect before adding dependencies

---

### Blocker Type 3: Merge Conflicts
**Common Causes**:
- Multiple agents editing same file
- Outdated local branch
- Complex refactoring in progress

**Solutions**:
- Coordinate work via PHASE_0_DEPENDENCIES.md
- Regular git pull from roadmap branch
- Use refactoring-coordinator skill (when US-102 complete)
- Stagger work on overlapping files

---

### Blocker Type 4: CFR-007 Violations
**Common Causes**:
- Loading too many files at startup
- Large prompt templates
- Excessive documentation in prompts

**Solutions**:
- Implement startup skills (US-062, US-063, US-064)
- Use lazy loading for non-critical resources
- Extract large docs to separate files
- Use context-budget-optimizer skill

---

## Blocker Prevention Checklist

**Before Starting Work**:
- [ ] Check PHASE_0_DEPENDENCIES.md (dependencies met?)
- [ ] Check PHASE_0_BLOCKERS.md (any active blockers?)
- [ ] Check git status (any uncommitted changes?)
- [ ] Run pytest (tests passing?)
- [ ] Check developer_status.json (other agents working on same files?)

**During Work**:
- [ ] Commit frequently (every 1-2 hours)
- [ ] Run tests after each significant change
- [ ] Monitor context budget (use context-budget-optimizer)
- [ ] Update developer_status.json with progress

**After Completing Work**:
- [ ] Run full test suite
- [ ] Verify DoD criteria
- [ ] Update PHASE_0_PROGRESS_TRACKER.md
- [ ] Create git tag if milestone reached

---

## Reporting Blockers

### User Report Blocker
```bash
poetry run project-manager report-blocker --severity CRITICAL \
  --user-story US-091 \
  --description "Code Index build failing with OOM error" \
  --suggested-fix "Increase memory limit or use incremental indexing"
```

### Agent Report Blocker (Python)
```python
from coffee_maker.cli.ai_service import AIService

service = AIService()
service.warn_user(
    title="BLOCKER: US-091 Code Index OOM",
    message="Code Index build failing due to out-of-memory error. "
            "Codebase too large for single-pass indexing. "
            "Suggest incremental indexing approach.",
    priority="critical",
    context={
        "user_story": "US-091",
        "error": "MemoryError: Cannot allocate 4GB for AST parsing",
        "suggested_fix": "Implement incremental indexing (parse one module at a time)"
    }
)
```
