## Individual Priority Status

### PRIORITY-28: Implement Notification Processing Loop
**Status in ROADMAP**: üìù Planned - CRITICAL (HIGHEST PRIORITY - DO THIS FIRST!)
**Specification**: SPEC-116 (referenced but not created yet)
**Created**: 2025-10-23
**Estimated Effort**: 4-6 hours
**Implementation Order**: #1 - MOST CRITICAL - DO THIS FIRST!
**Dependencies**: None (foundational service)

**Problem**:
- Notifications pile up in database with no processing mechanism
- Blocks workflow automation: architect creates spec ‚Üí no processing ‚Üí spec never linked ‚Üí code_developer stuck

**Solution**:
- Create notification processor in orchestrator or separate module
- Process pending notifications every 60 seconds
- Handle 3 notification types: `spec_complete`, `implementation_complete`, `review_changes_needed`

**Blocks**:
- PRIORITY-27 (code_reviewer DB integration)
- PRIORITY-29 (code_developer notifications)
- PRIORITY-30 (architect feedback loop)
- All workflow automation

**Success Criteria** (11 criteria listed):
- [ ] Notification processor implemented
- [ ] Processes at least 3 notification types
- [ ] Runs every 60 seconds
- [ ] Marks notifications as processed
- [ ] Spec links created within 5 minutes
- [ ] architect receives notifications
- [ ] Roadmap status updates automatically
- [ ] 15+ tests passing
- [ ] No stale notifications after 1 hour

---

### PRIORITY-27: Fix code_reviewer Database Integration
**Status in ROADMAP**: üìù Planned - CRITICAL (Depends on PRIORITY-28)
**Specification**: SPEC-117 (referenced but not created yet)
**Created**: 2025-10-23
**Estimated Effort**: 4-5 hours
**Implementation Order**: #2 - After PRIORITY-28
**Dependencies**: PRIORITY-28 (notification processor required)

**Problem**:
- code_reviewer writes review reports to files instead of database
- Breaks CFR-015 (database-only pattern)
- architect never gets notified of review issues
- No automated feedback loop

**Critical Issues Found**:
- Location: `coffee_maker/autonomous/code_reviewer.py` lines 713, 943
- Code: `report_path.write_text(content)` writes to files instead of database

**Solution**:
1. Create `review_reports` table in unified_database.py
2. Move review writing from files to database
3. Add database trigger for architect notification on low-quality reviews
4. Remove file-based review code

**Blocks**: PRIORITY-29, PRIORITY-30, Complete workflow automation

**Success Criteria** (6 criteria):
- [ ] review_reports table created
- [ ] code_reviewer writes to database
- [ ] Database trigger notifies architect on issues
- [ ] architect can query reviews
- [ ] Old file code removed
- [ ] Tests pass, zero regression

---

### PRIORITY-29: Add code_developer Completion Notifications
**Status in ROADMAP**: üìù Planned - CRITICAL (Depends on PRIORITY-28)
**Specification**: SPEC-118 (referenced but not created yet)
**Created**: 2025-10-23
**Estimated Effort**: 2-3 hours
**Implementation Order**: #3 - After PRIORITY-28
**Dependencies**:
- PRIORITY-28 (notification processor)
- PRIORITY-27 optional (database integration)

**Problem**:
- code_developer completes work but no one is notified
- Roadmap status never updates (stays "In Progress" forever)
- DoD verification never happens automatically
- Tasks appear stuck even when complete

**Solution**:
1. Add completion notification when code_developer finishes
2. Create notification: `implementation_complete` with roadmap_item_id, commit_sha
3. Send to project_manager
4. Include commit link and spec details

**Blocks**: DoD verification, Roadmap status updates, Workflow completion

**Success Criteria** (5 criteria):
- [ ] Notification sent on completion
- [ ] Includes: roadmap_item_id, commit_sha, spec_id
- [ ] Type: "implementation_complete"
- [ ] Recipient: "project_manager"
- [ ] Tests verify notification, zero regression

---

### PRIORITY-30: Architect Receives Review Notifications
**Status in ROADMAP**: üìù Planned - CRITICAL (Depends on PRIORITY-28, 27)
**Specification**: SPEC-119 (referenced but not created yet)
**Created**: 2025-10-23
**Estimated Effort**: 2-3 hours
**Implementation Order**: #4 - After PRIORITY-28 and PRIORITY-27
**Dependencies**:
- PRIORITY-28 (notification processor for delivery)
- PRIORITY-27 (database integration for reviews)

**Problem**:
- code_reviewer finds issues but architect is never notified
- No automated feedback loop
- Issues never get addressed
- architect must manually check review files (won't happen)

**Critical Issue**:
- Location: `coffee_maker/autonomous/code_reviewer.py` (complete_review method)
- Problem: Review marked as `changes_requested` but no notification

**Solution**:
1. Add notification when code_reviewer completes review with issues
2. Create notification: `review_changes_needed` when quality_score < 80 or approved = 0
3. architect automatically receives notification in database
4. architect can query database for detailed review info

**Blocks**: Complete feedback loop, Issue remediation, QA automation

**Success Criteria** (7 criteria):
- [ ] Notification sent when quality_score < 80
- [ ] Notification sent when approved = 0
- [ ] Includes: review_report_id, commit_sha, quality_score, issues
- [ ] Recipient: "architect"
- [ ] Type: "review_changes_needed"
- [ ] architect can query reviews
- [ ] Tests verify, zero regression

## Workflow Improvements Status

### ‚úÖ Stale Work Detection (Commit ed7a3d0)
**Status**: IMPLEMENTED
**Commit**: ed7a3d0 - "feat: Add stale work detection for code_developer"
**Date**: 2025-10-23 12:49:48

**What Was Done**:
- Added `implementation_started_at` and `implementation_started_by` fields to roadmap_items table
- Added methods to roadmap_database_v2.py:
  - `claim_implementation()` - Mark work as started
  - `release_implementation()` - Mark work as complete
  - `reset_stale_implementations()` - Reset work stuck >24 hours
- Created migration script for existing databases
- Added RoadmapDBSkill wrapper methods:
  - `claim_work()`
  - `release_work()`
  - `reset_stale_work()`

**Impact**: Prevents deadlock when code_developer crashes or gets stuck. Allows another code_developer to pick up stale work.

**Files Modified**:
- `coffee_maker/autonomous/roadmap_database_v2.py`
- `.claude/skills/shared/roadmap_database_handling/roadmap_db_skill.py`
- `coffee_maker/autonomous/migrate_add_implementation_tracking.py` (new)

### ‚úÖ Move Phase Field to Technical Specs (Commit 72a5c34)
**Status**: IMPLEMENTED
**Commit**: 72a5c34 - "feat: Move phase field from roadmap_items to technical_specs"
**Date**: 2025-10-23 12:52:29

**What Was Done**:
- Added `phase` column to technical_specs table in unified database
- Removed `phase` column from roadmap_items table
- Updated `roadmap_database_v2.create_item()` method (removed phase parameter)
- Created two migration scripts:
  - `migrate_move_phase_to_specs.py` (unified database)
  - `migrate_unified_impl_tracking.py`
- Migrated existing phase data from roadmap_items to linked specs

**Why This Matters**:
- One roadmap item can require multiple specs, each in different phases
- Better granularity: Each spec can have its own phase of implementation
- Proper architectural separation: Phase belongs with spec, not roadmap item

**Files Modified**:
- `coffee_maker/autonomous/unified_database.py`
- `coffee_maker/autonomous/roadmap_database_v2.py`
- `coffee_maker/autonomous/migrate_move_phase_to_specs.py` (new)
- `coffee_maker/autonomous/migrate_unified_impl_tracking.py` (new)

### ‚ùå Auto-Flagging Removal for Architect Reviews
**Status**: DOCUMENTED ONLY (No code change needed)
**Notes from Session**: "Remove auto-flagging for architect reviews"

**Current Status**:
- No code implementation found
- This was identified as a recommendation during workflow analysis
- Should be added to PRIORITY-28, 27, or 29 scope as a minor enhancement
- Prevents redundant notifications for already-reviewed changes

---

## Recommendations

### IMMEDIATE ACTIONS (Next Steps):

1. **Sync ROADMAP to Database**:
   - Create command or script to parse ROADMAP.md and populate unified database
   - Ensure priority numbering (27-30) is preserved
   - Set initial status to "üìù Planned" for all four

2. **Create Technical Specifications**:
   - SPEC-114: Notification Processor (for PRIORITY-28)
   - SPEC-115: code_reviewer Database Integration (for PRIORITY-27)
   - SPEC-116: code_developer Completion Notifications (for PRIORITY-29)
   - SPEC-117: Architect Review Notifications (for PRIORITY-30)

   **Action**: Update ROADMAP.md references from SPEC-116-119 to SPEC-114-117 for correct numbering

3. **Add Database Sync Task**:
   - Consider adding a PRIORITY-31 for "Database Sync Framework" if this becomes recurring task
   - Implement robustness against file->database drift

4. **Link Specs to Priorities**:
   - Once specs are created, update roadmap_items.spec_id to reference them
   - Update audit trail for traceability

### ARCHITECTURE NOTES:

**Critical Dependency Chain**:
```
PRIORITY-28 (Notification Processor) <- FOUNDATION
  ‚îú‚îÄ PRIORITY-27 (code_reviewer DB) <- Depends on PRIORITY-28
  ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ PRIORITY-30 (Architect Notifications) <- Depends on 28 + 27
  ‚îî‚îÄ PRIORITY-29 (code_developer Notifications) <- Depends on PRIORITY-28
      ‚îî‚îÄ PRIORITY-30 (Architect Notifications) <- Also depends on this

Implementation Order:
1. PRIORITY-28 (4-6 hours) <- CRITICAL PATH
2. PRIORITY-27 (4-5 hours) + PRIORITY-29 (2-3 hours) <- Can run in parallel
3. PRIORITY-30 (2-3 hours) <- Depends on 28 + 27

Total Estimated: ~12-17 hours (with parallelization: ~8-11 hours)
```

## Specification Number Clarification

**Issue**: ROADMAP references SPEC-116-119 but these numbers haven't been created yet.

**Current State**:
- SPEC-113 exists (Skill Enum Synchronization)
- SPEC-114, SPEC-115 are available
- SPEC-116-119 are beyond latest

**Resolution**:
- Create SPEC-114, SPEC-115, SPEC-116, SPEC-117 for the four priorities
- Update ROADMAP.md references to use correct numbers
