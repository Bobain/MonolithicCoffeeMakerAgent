# Workflow Failure: US-040 (Project Planner Mode)

**Date**: 2025-10-16
**Severity**: HIGH
**Type**: Process Failure

---

## What Happened

project_manager created US-040 (Project Planner Mode) and added it to ROADMAP without:
1. Checking CFR compatibility
2. Getting architect review
3. Warning user about potential issues

User identified that US-040 violates CFR-001 and cannot be made compatible.

---

## The Violation

**US-040 Concept**: User edits docs/roadmap/ while code_developer is paused.

**CFR-001 Violation**:
- docs/roadmap/ is owned by project_manager (CFR-001)
- User editing docs/roadmap/ = User acting as project_manager
- This violates ownership boundaries
- User cannot "become" an agent owner

**Why Not Compatible**:
- User cannot assume agent ownership
- Ownership must be exclusive to agents
- No convenient workaround exists
- Fundamental architecture conflict

---

## What SHOULD Have Happened

**Correct Workflow**:

```
User: "I want to plan while code_developer implements"
    ↓
project_manager: "Let me check CFR compatibility..."
    ↓
project_manager reads CRITICAL_FUNCTIONAL_REQUIREMENTS.md
    ↓
project_manager analyzes:
    - Does this violate CFR-001? YES
    - User would edit docs/roadmap/ directly
    - docs/roadmap/ owned by project_manager exclusively
    - User cannot "become" project_manager
    ↓
project_manager: "⚠️ WARNING: This would violate CFR-001

CFR-001 Violation Detected:
- docs/roadmap/ is owned by project_manager (exclusive ownership)
- User editing directly violates ownership boundaries
- User cannot assume agent ownership roles

Safe Alternatives:
1. Delegated Planning:
   - User tells project_manager what to plan
   - project_manager updates ROADMAP accordingly
   - Ownership respected, CFR-001 compliant

2. Planning Scratch Space:
   - User creates docs/planning_scratch/ (not owned by any agent)
   - User drafts plans freely
   - When ready, asks project_manager to formalize
   - Ownership respected, CFR-001 compliant

3. Voice Planning:
   - User dictates planning via conversation
   - assistant captures requirements
   - project_manager formalizes in ROADMAP
   - Ownership respected, CFR-001 compliant

Which approach would you prefer?"
    ↓
User: Makes informed decision with CFR-compatible approach
```

## Roles That Failed

### project_manager (Me) - PRIMARY FAILURE

**Failed to**:
- Check CFR compatibility before creating US
- Read CRITICAL_FUNCTIONAL_REQUIREMENTS.md
- Escalate to architect for technical review
- Warn user about violation
- Think critically about ownership implications

**Should have done**:
1. Read CRITICAL_FUNCTIONAL_REQUIREMENTS.md BEFORE creating US
2. Ask: "Does this violate any CFR?"
3. Identify: User editing docs/roadmap/ violates CFR-001
4. If uncertain: Escalate to architect
5. If violation found: Warn user, suggest alternatives
6. ONLY add to ROADMAP if CFR-compatible

### architect - SECONDARY FAILURE

**Failed to**:
- Review US-040 proactively
- Flag CFR violation
- Suggest alternative architectures

**Should have done**:
- Monitor new user stories for CFR violations
- Provide technical review before implementation
- Suggest CFR-compatible alternatives

---

## Root Causes

1. **No CFR validation gate**: User stories added to ROADMAP without CFR checks
2. **No architect review requirement**: architect not involved in US creation
3. **Reactive not proactive**: Agents don't review each other's work
4. **Missing safeguard**: No automatic CFR compatibility check
5. **Assumption violation**: Assumed user could "pause and work" without ownership conflict

---

## Impact

**User Impact**:
- User time wasted reading and approving invalid US
- User had to catch our mistake (role reversal - bad!)
- Trust degraded in agent decision-making

**System Impact**:
- ROADMAP pollution with invalid US
- Team resources allocated to doomed feature
- Documentation created for impossible feature

**Process Impact**:
- Demonstrated workflow gap
- Exposed lack of validation
- Revealed need for CFR enforcement

---

## Corrective Actions

### Immediate (This Session)
- [x] Remove US-040 completely from ROADMAP.md
- [x] Remove US-040 references from TEAM_COLLABORATION.md
- [x] Document this failure (this file)
- [x] Update US-039 to include US validation requirements
- [x] Apologize to user

### Short Term (Next Session)
- [ ] Implement CFR validation in project_manager US creation workflow
- [ ] Require architect review for new user stories (automated check)
- [ ] Add US validation tests
- [ ] Create US validation checklist for project_manager

### Long Term (Ongoing)
- [ ] Automated CFR compatibility checker
- [ ] Mandatory architect review gate
- [ ] reflector analyzes this failure pattern
- [ ] curator adds to playbook: "Always check CFRs before creating US"

---

## Lessons Learned

1. **Always check CFRs FIRST**: Before creating ANY user story, read CRITICAL_FUNCTIONAL_REQUIREMENTS.md
2. **Escalate when uncertain**: Better to ask architect than assume
3. **architect review is critical**: Technical validation prevents mistakes
4. **User should never catch our errors**: We failed if user finds issues BEFORE we do
5. **Ownership is sacred**: Cannot be violated, worked around, or temporarily transferred
6. **Intuition can be wrong**: "Pause and work" seemed reasonable but violated fundamental architecture

---

## CFR-Compatible Alternatives

If user wants to plan future work:

### Option 1: Delegated Planning ✅ CFR-COMPLIANT
```
User: Tells project_manager what to plan
    ↓
project_manager: Updates ROADMAP accordingly
    ↓
Result:
- Ownership respected (project_manager modifies docs/roadmap/)
- CFR-001 compliant
- User provides input, agent executes
```

### Option 2: Planning Scratch Space ✅ CFR-COMPLIANT
```
User: Creates docs/planning_scratch/ (not owned by any agent)
    ↓
User: Drafts plans freely in scratch space
    ↓
User: When ready, asks project_manager to formalize
    ↓
project_manager: Moves plans from scratch to ROADMAP.md
    ↓
Result:
- Ownership respected (docs/planning_scratch/ unowned)
- CFR-001 compliant
- User drafts freely, agent formalizes
```

### Option 3: Voice Planning ✅ CFR-COMPLIANT
```
User: Dictates planning via conversation
    ↓
assistant: Captures requirements
    ↓
project_manager: Formalizes in ROADMAP.md
    ↓
Result:
- Ownership respected (agents do file modifications)
- CFR-001 compliant
- Natural conversation-based workflow
```

## Prevent Recurrence

**New Workflow** (MUST implement in US-039):

```
1. project_manager receives user story creation request
    ↓
2. project_manager reads CRITICAL_FUNCTIONAL_REQUIREMENTS.md
    ↓
3. project_manager checks EVERY CFR:
   - CFR-001: Document Ownership Boundaries
   - CFR-002: Agent Role Boundaries
   - CFR-003: No Overlap - Documents
   - CFR-004: No Overlap - Responsibilities
   - CFR-005: Maintenance Responsibility
    ↓
4. project_manager asks for EACH CFR:
   - Does this US violate this CFR?
   - Is ownership clear and exclusive?
   - Can this be implemented without violations?
    ↓
5. If ANY doubt:
   - STOP immediately
   - Document concern
   - Escalate to architect for technical review
    ↓
6. architect reviews technical feasibility:
   - Confirms CFR compliance or violation
   - Suggests alternatives if needed
   - Provides architectural guidance
    ↓
7. If CFR violation confirmed:
   - BLOCK user story creation
   - Warn user with clear explanation
   - Provide 2-3 CFR-compatible alternatives
   - Wait for user decision
    ↓
8. ONLY if CFR-compatible:
   - Add to ROADMAP
   - Proceed with delegation flow
```

This MUST be added to US-039 (Comprehensive CFR Enforcement).

## Example Validation Failure (US-040)

**What project_manager SHOULD have detected**:

```
⚠️ CFR VIOLATION DETECTED DURING USER STORY CREATION

└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

Status: ❌ BLOCKED - Cannot add to ROADMAP

Safe Alternatives:
1. Delegated Planning:
   - User → project_manager (verbal planning)
   - project_manager → docs/roadmap/ (file modifications)
   - Ownership respected ✅

2. Scratch Space:
   - User → docs/planning_scratch/ (unowned directory)
   - project_manager → docs/roadmap/ (formalization)
   - Ownership respected ✅

3. Voice Planning:
   - User → assistant (conversation)
   - assistant → project_manager (requirements)
   - project_manager → docs/roadmap/ (documentation)
   - Ownership respected ✅

Which approach would you prefer?

## Apology to User

We (project_manager and architect) failed in our responsibilities:

**What we did wrong**:
1. Created invalid user story without CFR validation
2. Wasted your time reviewing and approving doomed feature
3. Made you catch our mistake (role reversal)
4. Demonstrated process failure in workflow

**What should have happened**:
1. project_manager checks CFRs BEFORE creating US
2. project_manager detects CFR-001 violation
3. project_manager warns you immediately
4. project_manager suggests CFR-compatible alternatives
5. You make informed decision with correct options

**We are implementing safeguards to prevent recurrence**:
- US-039 will include mandatory CFR validation
- architect review required for new user stories
- Automated CFR compatibility checker
- US validation checklist for project_manager

This should never have happened. We apologize for the failure.
