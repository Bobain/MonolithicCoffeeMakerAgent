## ⚠️ CRITICAL: ROADMAP PRIORITIZATION RULE

**🚨 THE ROADMAP MUST ALWAYS BE PRIORITIZED 🚨**

This roadmap is the **single source of truth** for the autonomous `code_developer` daemon. The daemon reads this file to determine its next task. To ensure smooth autonomous operation:

### Rules for Roadmap Maintenance

1. **Always Keep Priorities Ordered**
   - The daemon implements priorities in sequential order
   - "PRIORITY 1" → "PRIORITY 2" → "PRIORITY 2.5" → "PRIORITY 3" → etc.
   - Next task = First priority with status "📝 Planned"

2. **Update Status Immediately**
   - ✅ Mark as "✅ Complete" when done
   - 🔄 Mark as "🔄 In Progress" when actively working
   - ⏸️ Mark as "⏸️ Blocked" if waiting on external input
   - 🚧 Mark as "🚧 Manual Review Required" if daemon can't complete autonomously

3. **Be Specific About Deliverables**
   - Vague priorities cause infinite loops
   - List concrete files to create (e.g., "Create docs/QUICKSTART.md")
   - Specify acceptance criteria
   - Include examples when possible

4. **The "TOP PRIORITY" Section is Sacred**
   - Always keep section "🔴 TOP PRIORITY FOR code_developer" at the top
   - This tells the daemon exactly what to work on next
   - Update this section when priorities change

5. **Add New Priorities at the End**
   - Don't renumber existing priorities
   - Use decimal notation for insertions (e.g., PRIORITY 2.5, 2.6)
   - Maintain sequential order

6. **🚨 MANDATORY: Technical Specification Before Implementation** ⚡ **CRITICAL**
   - **NEVER start implementing a complex priority without a detailed technical specification**
   - For any priority with >1 day estimated duration, create a technical spec first
   - Technical spec must include:
     * **Prerequisites & Dependencies**: Verify ALL dependencies are available
     * **Architecture Overview**: High-level design with diagrams
     * **Component Specifications**: Detailed design for each module/class
     * **Data Flow Diagrams**: How data moves through the system
     * **Implementation Plan**: Step-by-step breakdown with time estimates
     * **Testing Strategy**: Unit, integration, and E2E test plans
     * **Security Considerations**: Authentication, authorization, data protection
     * **Performance Requirements**: Response times, resource limits
     * **Risk Analysis**: Identify risks and mitigation strategies
     * **Success Criteria**: Clear, measurable acceptance criteria
   - Document format: `docs/PRIORITY_X_TECHNICAL_SPEC.md`
   - **Example**: See `docs/PRIORITY_2_TECHNICAL_SPEC.md` (complete template)
   - **Why**: Prevents wasted effort, identifies blockers early, ensures quality
   - **When to skip**: Only for trivial tasks (<4 hours, no architecture decisions)

### Why This Matters

The daemon operates autonomously by:
1. Reading this ROADMAP.md file
2. Finding the next "📝 Planned" priority
3. Implementing it
4. Updating status
5. Moving to the next priority

**If the roadmap is not prioritized**, the daemon won't know what to do next and will:
- Get stuck in loops
- Skip important work
- Work on wrong priorities
- Create confusion and wasted effort

**Status**: ✅ Complete - 🔴 CRITICAL PRIORITY (Highest ROI - 40 hrs/month saved)

See [US-107](#us-107-dependency-conflict-resolver-skill) for full details.

**Strategic Value**: Automate dependency evaluation, save 40 hrs/month (93-95% time reduction)

**Created**: 2025-10-19

**Estimated Effort**: 2-3 days

**User Story**:
As architect, I want an automated dependency conflict resolver skill so that I can quickly evaluate dependency additions, detect conflicts, and provide recommendations without spending 45+ minutes on manual analysis.

**Problem Statement**:
Currently, architect spends significant time on dependency management:
- Manual dependency conflict detection (15-20 min per dependency)
- Manual security scanning (10-15 min)
- Manual license compatibility checks (5-10 min)
- Manual version compatibility analysis (10-15 min)
- **Total: 40-60 minutes per dependency addition**

This is the **#1 bottleneck** identified by the Acceleration Dashboard.

**Agent Role**: architect (skill)

**Skill Responsibilities**:

1. **Automated Dependency Evaluation**:
   - Parse pyproject.toml and poetry.lock
   - Check for version conflicts with existing dependencies
   - Analyze dependency tree depth and complexity
   - Identify circular dependencies

2. **Security Scanning**:
   - Check CVE databases (pip-audit, safety)
   - Scan for known vulnerabilities
   - Assess security risk level (Critical/High/Medium/Low)
   - Provide mitigation recommendations

3. **License Compatibility**:
   - Extract license from package metadata
   - Check compatibility with project license (Apache 2.0)
   - Flag GPL or incompatible licenses
   - Suggest alternatives if incompatible

4. **Version Analysis**:
   - Check if version is latest stable
   - Identify breaking changes in release notes
   - Suggest optimal version range (e.g., "^2.0.0")
   - Detect if version is deprecated

5. **Impact Assessment**:
   - Estimate installation time
   - Calculate bundle size impact
   - Identify sub-dependencies added
   - Check for platform compatibility

**Workflow**:

```bash
# architect wants to add a new dependency
architect dependency-conflict-resolver pytest-timeout

# Skill runs automatically:
# 1. Checks conflicts with existing deps
# 2. Scans for security vulnerabilities
# 3. Validates license compatibility
# 4. Analyzes version compatibility
# 5. Generates comprehensive report

# Output:
# ✅ pytest-timeout 2.2.0 - APPROVED
#
# Conflicts: None
# Security: No vulnerabilities (0 CVEs)
# License: MIT (✅ Compatible with Apache 2.0)
# Version: Latest stable (2.2.0)
# Bundle Size: +250 KB
# Sub-dependencies: 0 (no transitive deps)
#

### PRIORITY 23: US-108 - Parallel Agent Execution with Git Worktree ✅ Complete

**Status**: ✅ Complete (2025-10-19) - 🔴 CRITICAL PRIORITY (2x-3x Velocity Increase)

See [US-108](#us-108-parallel-agent-execution-with-git-worktree) for full details.

**Strategic Value**: Enable multiple code_developer instances to work in parallel, increasing velocity by 75-150%

**Created**: 2025-10-19

**Estimated Effort**: 3-4 days

**User Story**:
As orchestrator, I want the ability to spawn multiple agent instances using git worktree so that I can run multiple code_developer instances in parallel on technically separated tasks, dramatically increasing development velocity.

**Problem Statement**:
Currently, only ONE instance of each agent can run at a time (singleton enforcement):
- One code_developer works on one task sequentially
- Multiple parallelizable tasks sit idle in the ROADMAP
- The Acceleration Dashboard shows 12+ parallelizable tasks available
- Estimated velocity increase: +75% with 2nd developer (from dashboard analysis)
- No way to leverage parallel work even when tasks are independent

**Solution**:
Use git worktree to create separate working directories for parallel agent instances:
```bash
# Main workspace: /path/to/MonolithicCoffeeMakerAgent (branch: roadmap)
# Worktree 1: /path/to/MonolithicCoffeeMakerAgent-wt1 (branch: feature/us-065)
# Worktree 2: /path/to/MonolithicCoffeeMakerAgent-wt2 (branch: feature/us-066)
```

**Agent Role**: orchestrator (skill)

**Skill Responsibilities**:

1. **Task Separation Analysis**:
   - Ask architect to identify technically separated tasks
   - Ensure tasks don't have file conflicts
   - Verify tasks are truly independent (no shared files)
   - Prioritize high-value parallelizable work

2. **Git Worktree Management**:
   - Create new worktrees for each parallel task
   - Assign unique branch names (feature/us-XXX)
   - Track active worktrees and their assigned tasks
   - Clean up completed worktrees

3. **Agent Instance Spawning**:
   - Spawn code_developer in separate worktree directory
   - Assign specific task from ROADMAP
   - Monitor progress of each instance
   - Handle errors and failures gracefully

4. **Coordination & Merging**:
   - Track completion of each instance
   - Merge completed work back to roadmap branch
   - Resolve conflicts if any
   - Update ROADMAP status for all completed tasks

5. **Resource Management**:
   - Limit max concurrent instances (default: 2-3)
   - Monitor system resources (CPU, memory)
   - Scale down if resources constrained
   - Prevent too many parallel tasks

**Workflow**:

```bash
# 1. Orchestrator identifies work to parallelize
orchestrator: "I see 12 parallelizable tasks. Let me ask architect..."

# 2. Architect analyzes task separation
architect task-separator --identify-parallel
# Output: US-065 and US-066 are technically separated (no file conflicts)

# 3. Orchestrator spawns parallel instances
orchestrator parallel-execution --spawn \
  --task1 "US-065" --task2 "US-066"

# Creates:
# Worktree 1: MonolithicCoffeeMakerAgent-wt1 (feature/us-065)
#   - code_developer instance working on US-065
# Worktree 2: MonolithicCoffeeMakerAgent-wt2 (feature/us-066)
#   - code_developer instance working on US-066

# 4. Both instances work independently
# Worktree 1: Implements US-065, runs tests, commits
# Worktree 2: Implements US-066, runs tests, commits

# 5. Orchestrator monitors progress
orchestrator parallel-execution --status
# Worktree 1: 80% complete (testing phase)
# Worktree 2: 60% complete (implementation phase)

# 6. Instances complete, orchestrator merges
# Worktree 1: COMPLETE ✅
# Orchestrator: Merging feature/us-065 → roadmap
# Worktree 2: COMPLETE ✅
# Orchestrator: Merging feature/us-066 → roadmap

# 7. Clean up worktrees
git worktree remove MonolithicCoffeeMakerAgent-wt1
git worktree remove MonolithicCoffeeMakerAgent-wt2
```

**Benefits**:

- **Velocity Increase**: +75-150% development speed (2-3x with parallel work)
- **Better Resource Utilization**: Leverage idle CPU time

   # Analyzes tasks for file conflicts
   # Generates separation confidence score (0-100)
   # Recommends which tasks can run in parallel
   ```

4. **Orchestrator Integration**:
   - Check for parallelizable tasks in ROADMAP
   - Ask architect to analyze task separation
   - Spawn instances if tasks are independent
   - Monitor and merge completed work

**Git Worktree Primer**:

```bash
# Create worktree
git worktree add ../MonolithicCoffeeMakerAgent-wt1 -b feature/us-065

# List worktrees
git worktree list
# /path/to/MonolithicCoffeeMakerAgent  abc123 [roadmap]
# /path/to/MonolithicCoffeeMakerAgent-wt1  def456 [feature/us-065]

# Work in worktree (completely separate working directory)
cd ../MonolithicCoffeeMakerAgent-wt1
# Make changes, commit
git add .
git commit -m "Implement US-065"

# Back to main, merge
cd ../MonolithicCoffeeMakerAgent
git merge feature/us-065

# Remove worktree when done
git worktree remove ../MonolithicCoffeeMakerAgent-wt1
```

**Example Scenarios**:

1. **2 Independent Tasks** → Spawn 2 instances → Both complete → Merge both → 75% faster
2. **3 Parallelizable Tasks** → Spawn 3 instances → All complete → 150% faster
3. **Tasks Have Conflicts** → architect detects conflict → Run sequentially → No velocity loss
4. **Instance Fails** → Orchestrator detects → Cleanup worktree → Re-assign task → Resilient

**Integration with Existing System**:

```
orchestrator checks ROADMAP
       ↓
Sees 12 parallelizable tasks (from Acceleration Dashboard)
       ↓
Asks architect: "Can US-065 and US-066 run in parallel?"
       ↓
architect analyzes with task-separator skill
       ↓
architect: "✅ Independent (no file conflicts, confidence: 95%)"
       ↓
orchestrator spawns 2 code_developer instances in separate worktrees
       ↓
Both instances work independently
       ↓
Both complete, orchestrator merges → roadmap branch
       ↓
Clean up worktrees, continue with next tasks
```

**Safety Guarantees**:

- ✅ Each worktree enforces singleton (one agent per worktree)
- ✅ No file conflicts (architect pre-validates)
- ✅ Clean merges or manual resolution
- ✅ Rollback on errors
- ✅ Resource limits prevent exhaustion

**Success Metrics**:
- Velocity increase: +75% (2 instances) to +150% (3 instances)
- Successful merges: >90% automatic, <10% manual
- Resource utilization: <80% CPU, <80% memory
- Task throughput: 2-3x more tasks per day

**Dependencies**:
- Git worktree support (✅ Available in Git 2.5+)
- Architect task-separator skill (new)
- Orchestrator parallel coordination (new)

**Risks & Mitigation**:
- **Risk**: Merge conflicts → **Mitigation**: architect pre-validates file separation
- **Risk**: Resource exhaustion → **Mitigation**: Limit concurrent instances, monitor resources
- **Risk**: Instance crashes → **Mitigation**: Error handling, cleanup, task re-assignment

## 📝 PLANNED: US-023 - Clear, Intuitive Module Hierarchy

**Status**: 📝 **PLANNED** - High Priority for Library Usability

**As a**: Library user (developer consuming coffee_maker as a library)
**I want**: A clear, meaningful, and natural directory/module hierarchy in the codebase
**So that**: I can find reusable code at first sight and understand the codebase structure intuitively

**Business Value**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (High - Critical for library adoption and developer experience)
**Estimated Effort**: 3-4 days (Architecture restructuring + documentation)

### Problem Statement

Current issues with module hierarchy:
1. **Misnamed Directory**: `langfuse_observe/` suggests observability, but contains core LLM abstractions, rate limiting, and utilities
2. **Unclear Separation**: Only 13% (5 of 38 files) in `langfuse_observe/` actually use the `@observe` decorator
3. **Scattered Utilities**: Token estimation, HTTP pooling mixed with observability code
4. **No Clear Entry Points**: New users struggle to find where to start using the library
5. **Duplicate Exceptions**: langfuse_observe/exceptions.py duplicates coffee_maker/exceptions.py

### Current State Analysis

**Problematic Structure**:
```
coffee_maker/
├── langfuse_observe/          # Misleading name - not all about observability
│   ├── llm.py                 # Core LLM factory (no @observe)
│   ├── rate_limiting/         # Rate limit tracking (no @observe)
│   ├── strategies/            # Scheduling strategies (no @observe)
│   ├── http_pool.py           # HTTP utilities (no @observe)
│   ├── token_estimator.py     # Token counting (no @observe)
│   └── exceptions.py          # Duplicate of main exceptions
└── utils/                     # Generic utilities
    └── ...                    # Mixed concerns
```

**Analysis**: See `docs/LANGCHAIN_OBSERVE_ARCHITECTURE_REVIEW.md`

### Proposed Solution

**New Clear Structure**:
```
coffee_maker/
├── llm/                       # 🆕 Core LLM abstractions
│   ├── __init__.py            # Main exports: get_llm(), SmartLLM
│   ├── factory.py             # LLM creation and configuration
│   ├── builders.py            # Builder pattern (LLMBuilder, SmartLLM)
│   ├── rate_limiting/         # Rate limit tracking
│   │   ├── tracker.py
│   │   └── scheduler.py
│   ├── strategies/            # Fallback & scheduling strategies
│   │   ├── fallback.py
│   │   └── scheduling.py

│       ├── openai.py
│       ├── anthropic.py
│       └── gemini.py
├── observability/             # 🆕 Pure observability (Langfuse)
│   ├── __init__.py
│   ├── agents.py              # @observe decorated agents
│   ├── cost_calculator.py     # @observe decorated cost tracking
│   ├── retry.py               # @observe decorated retry logic
│   └── analytics/             # Analytics with tracing
├── utils/                     # General utilities
│   ├── http_pool.py           # Moved from langfuse_observe
│   ├── token_estimator.py     # Moved from langfuse_observe
│   ├── logging.py
│   ├── retry.py (generic)
│   └── ...
└── exceptions.py              # Single source of truth (consolidate)
```

### Definition of Done

**Phase 1: Planning & Documentation** (0.5 days)
- [x] Architecture review complete (`docs/LANGCHAIN_OBSERVE_ARCHITECTURE_REVIEW.md`)
- [ ] Create migration plan document (`docs/US-023_MIGRATION_PLAN.md`)
- [ ] Document new module guidelines (`docs/MODULE_ORGANIZATION_GUIDE.md`)
- [ ] Get user approval for structure

**Phase 2: Core Restructuring** (2 days)
- [ ] Create new `coffee_maker/llm/` directory
- [ ] Move 33 misplaced files from `langfuse_observe/` to correct locations:
  - LLM core → `llm/`
  - Rate limiting → `llm/rate_limiting/`
  - Strategies → `llm/strategies/`
  - Utilities → `utils/`
- [ ] Rename `langfuse_observe/` → `observability/`
- [ ] Keep only `@observe`-decorated files in `observability/`
- [ ] Consolidate exceptions:
  - Merge `langfuse_observe/exceptions.py` into `coffee_maker/exceptions.py`
  - Remove duplicates
- [ ] Create clear `__init__.py` exports for each package

**Phase 3: Update Imports & Tests** (1 day)
- [ ] Update all import statements (estimated 100+ files)
- [ ] Run full test suite to verify no breakage
- [ ] Update documentation to reflect new structure
- [ ] Create migration guide for external users

**Phase 4: Documentation & Examples** (0.5 days)
- [ ] Update README with clear usage examples
- [ ] Document module hierarchy in `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`
- [ ] Add "Getting Started" guide showing module structure
- [ ] Create visual diagram of module relationships

### Key Principles

1. **Purpose-Driven Organization**: Group by purpose, not by implementation detail
2. **Clear Naming**: Directory names reflect content (`llm/` for LLM code, not `langfuse_observe/`)
3. **Shallow Hierarchy**: Prefer flat over deep (max 2-3 levels)
4. **Explicit Exports**: Clear `__init__.py` with `__all__` for each package
5. **Single Responsibility**: Each module has one clear purpose
6. **Discoverable**: New users can find what they need by directory name alone

### Import Examples After Restructuring

**Before** (Confusing):
```python
# Where do I find LLM creation?
from coffee_maker.langfuse_observe.llm import get_llm  # Why langfuse?
from coffee_maker.langfuse_observe.builder import SmartLLM  # Still langfuse?
```

**After** (Clear):
```python
# Obvious location for LLM code
from coffee_maker.llm import get_llm, SmartLLM
from coffee_maker.llm.builders import LLMBuilder

# Observability is separate
from coffee_maker.observability import track_cost, retry_with_backoff
```

### Success Metrics

- [ ] All modules organized by purpose (not implementation)
- [ ] Directory names match content (self-documenting)
- [ ] Max 2-3 directory depth
- [ ] Clear `__init__.py` exports for all packages
- [ ] Zero import errors after restructuring
- [ ] Documentation reflects new structure
- [ ] New user can find LLM code in < 30 seconds
- [ ] Import paths are intuitive and memorable

### Related Work

- ✅ Phase 0: Naming Improvements (completed - removed `_utils` suffixes)
- ✅ Phase 2.4: Directory rename (completed - `langchain_observe` → `langfuse_observe`)
- 📝 US-023: Full architecture restructuring (this user story)

### Technical Specification

Create detailed spec: `docs/US-023_TECHNICAL_SPEC.md`

**Contents**:
1. File-by-file move plan
2. Import update checklist (all 100+ affected files)
3. Test verification strategy
4. Rollback procedure if issues found
5. Breaking changes for external users (if any)

### Priority Justification

**High Priority** because:
1. **Library Usability**: Essential for developers using coffee_maker as a library
2. **Onboarding**: New contributors can't navigate current structure
3. **Maintainability**: Clear structure reduces future technical debt
4. **Professional**: Well-organized code signals quality project

**Dependencies**: None (can start immediately after US-021 Phase 2.5)

## ✅ RECENTLY COMPLETED: US-010 - Living Documentation & Tutorials

**Project**: **📚 US-010 - Living Documentation & Tutorials**

**Status**: ✅ **COMPLETE** (Completed 2025-10-10)

**Goal**: ✅ Created comprehensive, up-to-date documentation with tutorials so assistants can help users understand and use all deliverables

**User Story**:
> "As an assistant of the developer, I want to keep up to date the documentation and be aware of it, I also want to have a summary with tutorials so that 1) I can better understand the use of deliverables 2) I can answer questions from the user about how to use the deliverables"

**Success Criteria** (6/6 - 100%):
- [x] Central documentation hub created (DOCUMENTATION_INDEX.md)
- [x] All existing docs indexed and described
- [x] Quickstart updated with US-009 features
- [x] At least 5 practical tutorials created (TUTORIALS.md - 7 delivered!)

---

## ✅ COMPLETE: US-011 - Developer Documentation Requirements

**Project**: **📝 US-011 - Developer Documentation Requirements for Assistants**

**Status**: ✅ **COMPLETE** (2025-10-16)

**Goal**: Define what documentation the developer must create when implementing features, so assistants can help users effectively

**User Story**:
> "As an assistant I need specific documents from the developer to be able to meet what the project_manager expects from me."

**The Problem** (Was):
When the developer implemented a feature, they may not have created the documentation that assistants need to help users. This created a knowledge gap where:
- Assistants didn't know how new features work
- Users couldn't get help from assistants
- Project manager had to answer every question manually

**Solution Delivered**:

### 1. Developer Documentation Template Created ✅

**File**: `docs/templates/DEVELOPER_DOCUMENTATION_TEMPLATE.md` (607 lines)

Comprehensive template with 5 required documentation types:

1. **USER_GUIDE.md** - Step-by-step usage instructions
   - Quick Start (2 minutes)
   - Common Use Cases
   - All Available Options
   - When to Use vs When Not to Use
   - Examples with expected output

2. **API_REFERENCE.md** - Complete API documentation
   - Functions/Commands with parameters
   - Return values and error codes
   - Code examples for each
   - Error reference table

3. **TROUBLESHOOTING.md** - Common issues and solutions
   - Symptoms, Cause, Solution format
   - Debug mode instructions
   - Getting Help section

4. **CHANGELOG_ENTRY.md** - What changed
   - Added, Changed, Fixed, Deprecated, Security sections
   - Breaking changes highlighted
   - Migration guides

5. **Updated Technical Spec** - Implementation results
   - What Was Actually Built
   - Deviations from Original Spec
   - How It Works (architecture, data flow)
   - Performance Characteristics
   - Known Limitations

### 2. Definition of Done Updated ✅

**File**: `docs/COLLABORATION_METHODOLOGY.md` (Section 6.2, lines 3222-3234)

Added to DoD checklist:
- [ ] User Guide created (how to use the feature)
- [ ] API Reference created (if feature has commands/functions)
- [ ] Troubleshooting section added (common errors + solutions)
- [ ] Changelog entry added (what changed)
- [ ] Technical Spec updated with implementation results

**Key Quote**: "If assistants can't help users with your feature, the feature isn't done!"

### 3. PR Review Checklist Created ✅

**File**: `.github/pull_request_template.md`

Includes documentation requirement:
- [ ] Developer documentation created per template (docs/templates/DEVELOPER_DOCUMENTATION_TEMPLATE.md)

### 4. Developer Workflow Integration ✅

Documentation requirements are now:
- Part of Definition of Done (enforced)
- In PR review checklist (visible)
- Referenced in template with clear examples

**Example from Template** (US-009 - What developer should have created):
```markdown
1. User Guide: docs/USER_GUIDE_DAEMON_CONTROL.md
2. API Reference: docs/API_REFERENCE_DAEMON_CONTROL.md
3. Troubleshooting: Section in docs/TROUBLESHOOTING.md
4. Changelog: Entry in docs/CHANGELOG.md
5. Technical Spec: US-009_TECHNICAL_SPEC.md (updated with implementation results)
```

### Success Criteria (All Met) ✅

- [x] Template created for developer documentation deliverables (607 lines)
- [x] Added to Definition of Done checklist (COLLABORATION_METHODOLOGY.md updated)
- [x] Developer knows exactly what docs to create (template + examples)
- [x] Assistants have all info needed to help users (5 doc types cover everything)
- [x] Every feature has user guide, API reference, troubleshooting (enforced in DoD)
- [x] PR review checklist includes documentation (created)

### Impact

**Before US-011**:
- No standard for developer documentation
- Assistants lacked information to help users
- Project manager created docs after implementation

**After US-011**:
- Clear template with 5 required doc types
- Documentation is part of Definition of Done
- Developers create docs during implementation
- Assistants can help users effectively
- PR reviews check for documentation

### Files Created/Modified

**Created**:
- `.github/pull_request_template.md` - PR review checklist

**Modified**:
- `docs/ROADMAP.md` - Marked US-011 as COMPLETE

**Already Existed** (Part of US-011 implementation):
- `docs/templates/DEVELOPER_DOCUMENTATION_TEMPLATE.md` - Created earlier
- `docs/COLLABORATION_METHODOLOGY.md` - DoD already updated (Section 6.2)

**Estimated**: 2-3 hours | **Actual**: 2 hours

## 📝 READY TO IMPLEMENT: US-012 - Natural Language User Story Management

**Project**: **💬 US-012 - `/US` Command with Conversational Validation Workflow**

**Status**: 📝 **PLANNED** (2025-10-10 - DoD defined, ready to implement)

**User Story**:
> "As a user I want to interact with the project manager with natural language, I want him to translate what I say into user stories. We will validate together the user stories we will prioritize, de-prioritize, which ones to put into the backlog as new user story or how to rephrase an old one which covers part of user's need, etc."

**Definition of Done**:
> "In the project_manager UI it is possible to say `/US I want to be able to [...]` and the project manager will share ideas with the user about what he will rephrase as a user story, wait for the user to validate, then propagate the information in the roadmap."

**Key Requirements**:
1. **New Command**: `/US [description]` in project_manager chat
2. **Conversational Validation**: PM shares structured US draft, waits for user approval
3. **Propagation**: Only after validation, PM adds to ROADMAP.md
4. **Workflow**: Share ideas → Validate → Propagate (NOT immediate addition)

**Current Capabilities**:
✅ Natural language chat interface exists
✅ AI can extract user stories from natural language (`AIService.extract_user_story()`)
✅ AI can analyze roadmap impact (`AIService.analyze_user_story_impact()`)
✅ PM can add/update user stories in ROADMAP.md
✅ PM asks clarifying questions

**What Needs Enhancement**:
1. **Collaborative validation workflow**: After extracting US, present it to user for validation before adding to roadmap
2. **Similarity detection**: Check existing user stories and suggest if one can be rephrased instead of creating new
3. **Prioritization conversation**: Help user decide: TOP PRIORITY, backlog, or defer
4. **Impact analysis**: Show how new US affects existing roadmap (timeline, dependencies)
5. **Backlog management**: Clear process for moving between backlog ↔ active priorities
6. **Rephrasing workflow**: When existing US partially covers need, suggest rephrase instead of duplicate

**Example Desired Workflow**:
```
User: "/US I want to be able to receive email notifications when code_developer finishes a task"

PM: "I've extracted this user story from your description:

**US-XXX: Email Notifications on Task Completion**

**As a**: User
**I want**: Email notifications when code_developer completes tasks
**So that**: I stay informed without checking manually

**Business Value**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (High - improves awareness)
**Estimated Effort**: 3-5 days (notification system, email templates, config)

Does this capture your need? Any changes?"

User: "Yes, also when daemon asks me questions"

PM: "Updated:

**US-XXX: Email & Question Notifications**

**As a**: User
**I want**: Email notifications when code_developer completes tasks OR asks questions
**So that**: I stay informed and can respond quickly

**Features**:
- Email when tasks complete
- Email when daemon has questions
- Configurable notification preferences (frequency, types)

**Analysis**: I found US-008 (Automated User Support) mentions notifications.

Should I:
A) Create new US-XXX for email notifications
B) Expand US-008 to include email functionality
C) Keep separate and link them

Also, where should this go?
- TOP PRIORITY (implement next)
- After US-011 (planned work)
- Backlog (future consideration)"

User: "Create new, make it after US-011"

PM: "✅ Perfect! I've:
1. Created US-XXX: Email & Question Notifications
2. Prioritized after US-011 in roadmap
3. Marked status as 📝 Planned
4. Linked to US-008 for cross-reference

You can see it in the roadmap now. Want to create another user story?"
```

**Technical Foundation** (Already Exists):
- `RoadmapEditor.add_user_story()` - Add US to roadmap
- `RoadmapEditor.get_user_story_summary()` - List all user stories
- `AIService.extract_user_story()` - Parse natural language
- `AIService.analyze_user_story_impact()` - Roadmap impact
- Chat interface with conversation history

**What to Build**:
1. **Conversational validation loop**: Extract → Present → User validates → Refine → Confirm
2. **Similarity matcher**: Compare new US against existing ones
3. **Prioritization helper**: Suggest placement based on dependencies, business value
4. **Rephrasing workflow**: Show existing US and propose updated version
5. **Documentation**: Update TUTORIALS.md with examples of natural US creation

**Implementation Plan**:

**Phase 1: Core `/US` Command** (2-3 hours)
1. Add `/US` command handler in `chat_interface.py`
2. Parse command arguments (description text)
3. Call `AIService.extract_user_story()`
4. Present draft to user (formatted markdown)
5. Wait for user response (validation loop)

**Phase 2: Similarity Detection** (2-3 hours)
1. Search existing user stories in ROADMAP
2. Use fuzzy matching or semantic similarity
3. Present options: create new, expand existing, or rephrase
4. Let user decide

**Phase 3: Prioritization Helper** (1-2 hours)
1. Ask user: TOP PRIORITY, after specific US, or backlog?
2. Analyze dependencies and suggest placement
3. Show impact on timeline

**Phase 4: Propagation to Roadmap** (1 hour)
1. After validation, call `RoadmapEditor.add_user_story()`
2. Update ROADMAP.md with new US
3. Confirm to user with link/reference

**Phase 5: Documentation & Polish** (1 hour)
1. Update TUTORIALS.md with `/US` examples
2. Add to PROJECT_MANAGER_FEATURES.md
3. Test end-to-end workflow

**Total Estimated**: 1-2 days (7-10 hours)

**Acceptance Criteria** (Definition of Done):
- [ ] `/US` command exists in project_manager chat interface
- [ ] User can type: `/US I want to be able to [description]`
- [ ] PM extracts and structures the user story from description
- [ ] PM shares ideas about how to rephrase as user story
- [ ] PM presents draft user story to user
- [ ] PM waits for user validation (does NOT auto-add to roadmap)
- [ ] User can request changes/refinements
- [ ] After validation, PM propagates to ROADMAP.md
- [ ] PM detects similar existing user stories and offers options
- [ ] PM helps with prioritization (TOP PRIORITY, backlog, etc.)
- [ ] PM can suggest rephrasing existing US vs creating new
- [ ] Entire workflow feels conversational (not form-filling)

## 📝 READY TO IMPLEMENT: US-013 - PM Infers and Validates DoD for Every User Story

**Project**: **✅ US-013 - Automatic DoD Inference During `/US` Workflow**

**Status**: 📝 **PLANNED** (2025-10-10 - Part of `/US` command implementation)

**User Story**:
> "As a project manager I want the developer to be productive and reliable, therefore I will define a DoD if the user does not give one. But first I will ask the user if he has a DoD"

**Business Context**:
Every user story needs a Definition of Done (DoD) to ensure quality and completeness. The PM should help users define DoD by:
1. Asking if user has a DoD in mind
2. If not, inferring DoD from the user's description
3. Rephrasing it clearly for validation
4. User validates and confirms

**Integration with US-012**:
This feature enhances the `/US` command workflow (US-012). When user describes their need, PM should:
1. Extract user story structure (US-012)
2. **Check for similar existing user stories (US-013)** ← New
3. **Check if already shipped or partially done (US-013)** ← New
4. **Identify what's missing if partially done (US-013)** ← New
5. **Rephrase findings for user validation (US-013)** ← New
6. User validates the user story itself first
7. **ONLY THEN infer Definition of Done (US-013)** ← New
8. Present DoD for validation
9. User validates DoD
10. Propagate to ROADMAP with complete DoD

**Workflow (Complete with Similarity Check)**:
```
User: "/US I want email notifications when daemon finishes tasks"

PM: "I'm checking if this already exists or is similar to something we have...

Found: US-009 includes notification system, but no email support.

I see three options:
A) Enhance US-009 to add email notifications (already 60% done)
B) Create new US-XXX for email-specific notifications
C) US-009 is complete; email is already working (please test)

Which approach would you prefer?"

User: "Create new US, separate from US-009"

PM: "Got it! Here's the user story I've extracted:

**US-XXX: Email Notifications on Task Completion**

**As a**: User
**I want**: Email notifications when code_developer completes tasks
**So that**: I stay informed without checking manually

**Business Value**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (High - reduces manual monitoring)
**Estimated Effort**: 3-5 days (email service, templates, config)

Is this user story correct? Any changes?"

User: "Yes, and also when daemon asks questions"

PM: "Updated user story:

**US-XXX: Email & Question Notifications**

**As a**: User
**I want**: Email notifications when code_developer completes tasks OR asks questions
**So that**: I stay informed and can respond quickly

**Business Value**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (Critical - enables async workflow)
**Estimated Effort**: 4-6 days (notification triggers, email templates, config)

Now let me infer the Definition of Done...

**Definition of Done** (inferred from your description):
- [ ] Email sent when code_developer completes a task
- [ ] Email sent when code_developer asks a question
- [ ] Email includes task summary and results
- [ ] Email includes question context and link
- [ ] User can configure notification preferences (frequency, types)
- [ ] Email delivered within 1 minute of event
- [ ] Tests verify email sending works
- [ ] Documentation shows how to configure

Does this Definition of Done look good, or do you have different criteria?"

User: "Add: Email should include link to PR when task completes"

PM: "Updated DoD:
- [ ] Email sent when code_developer completes a task
- [ ] Email includes PR link when task completes ← Added
- [ ] Email sent when code_developer asks a question
- [ ] Email includes task summary and results
- [ ] Email includes question context and link
- [ ] User can configure notification preferences
- [ ] Email delivered within 1 minute of event
- [ ] Tests verify email sending works
- [ ] Documentation shows how to configure

Is this correct now?"

User: "Yes, perfect"

PM: "✅ Added US-XXX: Email & Question Notifications to ROADMAP with complete Definition of Done"
```

**Implementation Approach**:

**Phase 1: Similarity Check & User Story Validation** (2-3 hours)
1. When user provides US description via `/US` command
2. PM searches ROADMAP for similar user stories
3. PM checks if request is already shipped (completed user stories)
4. PM identifies what's missing if partially done
5. PM presents findings with options:
   - Create new user story
   - Enhance existing user story
   - Already complete (user should test)
6. User validates and chooses approach
7. PM extracts/refines user story structure
8. User validates the user story itself (before DoD)

**Phase 2: DoD Inference** (1-2 hours)
1. ONLY AFTER user story is validated, PM infers DoD
2. PM analyzes validated description to extract implicit success criteria
3. PM generates DoD checklist based on:
   - Functional requirements mentioned
   - Standard quality criteria (tests, docs, validation)
   - Non-functional requirements (performance, security if applicable)

**Phase 3: DoD Validation** (1 hour)
1. PM presents inferred DoD to user
2. PM asks: "Does this Definition of Done look good, or do you have different criteria?"
3. User can:
   - Accept as-is
   - Request modifications
   - Provide their own DoD completely
4. Iterative refinement until user confirms

**Phase 4: DoD Storage** (30 min)
1. Store validated DoD with user story in ROADMAP
2. Ensure DoD is visible and checkable
3. Use checklist format for tracking completion

**Acceptance Criteria** (Definition of Done):
- [ ] PM checks for similar existing user stories before creating new one
- [ ] PM checks if request is already shipped (in completed user stories)
- [ ] PM identifies what's missing if partially done
- [ ] PM presents findings and options to user (new, enhance, or already done)
- [ ] User validates the user story structure BEFORE DoD work begins
- [ ] ONLY AFTER user story validation, PM infers DoD from description
- [ ] Inferred DoD includes functional criteria (what the feature does)
- [ ] Inferred DoD includes quality criteria (tests, docs, validation)
- [ ] PM asks user if they have a different DoD in mind
- [ ] User can accept, modify, or replace inferred DoD
- [ ] DoD stored in ROADMAP with user story
- [ ] DoD uses checklist format for tracking
- [ ] Workflow feels natural (not form-filling)

**Technical Foundation**:
- `AIService` can analyze user descriptions and extract success criteria
- `RoadmapEditor.get_user_story_summary()` - List all user stories for similarity check
- ROADMAP.md already has DoD sections in user stories
- Chat interface supports conversational validation
- Section 6 of COLLABORATION_METHODOLOGY.md defines DoD template

**Estimated Effort**: 5-7 hours (integrated with US-012 implementation)
- Phase 1 (Similarity Check): 2-3 hours
- Phase 2 (DoD Inference): 1-2 hours
- Phase 3 (DoD Validation): 1 hour
- Phase 4 (DoD Storage): 30 min

**Dependencies**: US-012 (part of same `/US` command workflow)

## 📝 READY TO IMPLEMENT: US-014 - Intelligent Request Categorization and Document Routing

**Project**: **🧠 US-014 - PM Context Awareness: Auto-Detect Feature vs Methodology Changes**

**Status**: 📝 **PLANNED** (2025-10-10 - Requirements defined)

**User Story**:
> "As a project manager, I need to be able to interpret the user's context: what part of what he is saying are user stories, and what parts concerns the collaboration methodologies, or both. I can ask him to make sure I understood as I need to get sure which documents should be updated (roadmap, collaboration methodology, etc)"

**Business Context**:
When users communicate with PM, their input can be:
- **Feature requests** → Add to `ROADMAP.md` as user stories
- **Process/methodology changes** → Document in `COLLABORATION_METHODOLOGY.md`
- **Both** → Update both documents
- **Ambiguous** → PM needs to ask clarifying questions

Currently, PM may not always correctly identify which type of input it's receiving, leading to:
- Information being documented in the wrong place
- Methodology changes lost or treated as features
- Features mistakenly documented as process changes

**What PM Should Do**:

**Step 1: Analyze user input**
```
User says: "I want email notifications when tasks complete"
→ PM detects: FEATURE REQUEST (action to build)
→ Route to: ROADMAP.md

User says: "PM should always use plain language with me"
→ PM detects: METHODOLOGY CHANGE (how we work)
→ Route to: COLLABORATION_METHODOLOGY.md

User says: "PM should detect when I'm describing a feature vs methodology change"
→ PM detects: BOTH (feature to build + how PM should work)
→ Route to: ROADMAP.md + COLLABORATION_METHODOLOGY.md
```

**Step 2: Ask clarifying questions when ambiguous**
```
User says: "I need better status updates"

PM responds: "I want to make sure I understand correctly:

Is this:
A) A new feature to build (e.g., automated status report emails)?
B) A change to how I communicate status (e.g., different format)?
C) Both (build feature + change process)?

This helps me know whether to update ROADMAP.md,
COLLABORATION_METHODOLOGY.md, or both."
```

**Step 3: Explicitly state which documents will be updated**
```
PM: "Got it! This is a feature request, so I'll:
1. Create a user story in ROADMAP.md
2. Document it as US-XXX

Proceeding..."
```

**Acceptance Criteria** (Definition of Done):

**Detection & Classification**:
- [ ] PM analyzes user input to detect type: feature, methodology, or both
- [ ] PM uses contextual clues (keywords, phrasing, intent) to classify
- [ ] PM correctly identifies ambiguous requests requiring clarification

**Clarifying Questions**:
- [ ] When ambiguous, PM asks: "Is this a feature to build, or a process change?"
- [ ] PM presents options clearly (A/B/C format)
- [ ] PM explains why the question matters (which docs get updated)
- [ ] User can respond naturally, PM interprets the response

**Document Routing**:
- [ ] Feature requests → ROADMAP.md (user stories)
- [ ] Methodology changes → COLLABORATION_METHODOLOGY.md (process updates)
- [ ] Hybrid requests → Both documents (cross-referenced)
- [ ] PM explicitly states which documents will be updated before doing so

**Validation & Confirmation**:
- [ ] PM summarizes what was understood before updating documents
- [ ] User can correct misinterpretations
- [ ] PM confirms successful update: "Added to ROADMAP.md as US-XXX"

**Examples Handled Correctly**:
- [ ] "I want X feature" → Correctly routes to ROADMAP
- [ ] "PM should always do Y" → Correctly routes to METHODOLOGY
- [ ] "PM needs ability to detect Z" → Correctly identifies as BOTH
- [ ] Ambiguous input → PM asks clarifying questions

**Documentation**:
- [ ] Section added to COLLABORATION_METHODOLOGY.md explaining this behavior
- [ ] Examples of each category type documented
- [ ] Guidelines for when to ask clarifying questions

**Implementation Approach**:

**Phase 1: Classification Logic** (1-2 days)
1. Define classification keywords/patterns:
   - Feature indicators: "I want", "add feature", "build", "implement"
   - Methodology indicators: "PM should", "always do", "process", "workflow", "methodology"
   - Both indicators: "PM needs capability to", "PM should be able to"
2. Implement classification function in AIService
3. Test with historical examples

**Phase 2: Clarification Workflow** (1 day)
1. When confidence < 80%, trigger clarification
2. Generate contextual clarifying questions
3. Parse user's clarification response
4. Re-classify based on clarification

**Phase 3: Document Routing** (1 day)
1. Based on classification, determine target documents
2. Explicitly state routing decision to user
3. Update appropriate documents
4. Cross-reference when updating both

**Phase 4: Methodology Documentation** (30 min)
1. Add Section 3.2.1 to COLLABORATION_METHODOLOGY.md
2. Document classification approach
3. Provide examples of each category

**Technical Foundation**:
- `AIService` - Can analyze and classify natural language input
- `RoadmapEditor` - Can add user stories to ROADMAP.md
- Chat interface - Can ask follow-up questions
- File editing capabilities - Can update COLLABORATION_METHODOLOGY.md

**Estimated Effort**: 3-5 days (classification logic, testing, documentation)

**Priority**: HIGH (prevents information loss, improves PM effectiveness)

**Example Scenarios**:

**Scenario 1: Clear Feature Request**
```
User: "I want email notifications when code_developer completes tasks"

PM: "I've detected this as a feature request.

I'll create a user story in ROADMAP.md for:
- Email notification system
- Trigger on task completion
- Integration with existing notification system

Proceeding with user story creation..."
```

**Scenario 2: Clear Methodology Change**
```
User: "PM should always confirm which documents will be updated before making changes"

PM: "I've detected this as a methodology change.

I'll update COLLABORATION_METHODOLOGY.md to add:
- Requirement for PM to explicitly state document routing
- Confirmation step before updating documents

Proceeding with methodology update..."
```

**Scenario 3: Ambiguous (Requires Clarification)**
```
User: "I need better documentation"

PM: "I want to make sure I understand correctly.

Is this:
A) A feature request to auto-generate documentation (→ ROADMAP.md)?
B) A process change for how I should document things (→ COLLABORATION_METHODOLOGY.md)?
C) Both - build auto-doc feature AND change documentation process?

Understanding this helps me know which documents to update."

User: "Both - build the feature and improve the process"

PM: "Perfect! I'll:
1. Create user story in ROADMAP.md for auto-documentation feature
2. Update COLLABORATION_METHODOLOGY.md with improved documentation process
3. Cross-reference the two

Proceeding..."
```

## 📝 PLANNED: US-015 - Estimation Metrics & Velocity Tracking

**Project**: **📊 US-015 - Track Estimation Accuracy and Team Velocity for Better Planning**

**Status**: 📝 **PLANNED** (2025-10-10 - Requirements defined)

**User Story**:
> "As a project manager I want to have metrics stored about my estimations of time to deliver and the velocity of the team, so that I can adjust my estimations based on past errors or good estimations"

**Business Context**:
Currently, PM estimates time for user stories (e.g., "3-5 days") but has no way to:
- Track actual time taken vs estimated time
- Measure estimation accuracy over time
- Calculate team velocity (how much work gets done per sprint/week)
- Learn from past estimation errors to improve future estimates
- Identify patterns in over/under-estimation

This leads to:
- ❌ Repeated estimation mistakes (same types of work always take longer than estimated)
- ❌ No data-driven approach to planning
- ❌ Can't answer "When will this be done?" with confidence
- ❌ No visibility into team velocity trends

**What PM Should Do**:

**Metrics to Track**:

**Per User Story Level** (primary granularity):
1. **Time Metrics**:
   - Estimated time from ROADMAP (e.g., "3-5 days" → stored as min: 3, max: 5)
   - Actual time taken (calculated from start to completion)
   - Estimation error (actual - estimated)
   - Estimation accuracy percentage

2. **Velocity Metrics**:
   - Story points completed per week/sprint
   - Number of user stories completed per time period
   - Average story duration
   - Velocity trend (improving/declining)

**Per Technical Spec Level** (when spec exists):
3. **Spec Estimation Metrics**:
   - Estimated time from technical spec (e.g., "Phase 1: 6 hours")
   - Actual time per spec phase (allows adjusting spec estimates)
   - Which spec phases consistently over/under-estimated
   - Spec-level accuracy (helps improve future spec estimates)

**Overall Accuracy**:
4. **Accuracy Metrics**:
   - Overall estimation accuracy (% of estimates within ±20%)
   - Trend: improving or declining accuracy
   - Category-specific accuracy (e.g., better at estimating UI work vs backend)
   - Spec vs no-spec accuracy (do specs improve estimates?)

**Where to Display**:
- `/status` command shows current velocity and recent accuracy
- `/metrics` command shows detailed historical data
- When estimating new work, PM suggests adjusted estimates based on historical data

**Database Schema** (SQLite):

```sql
-- New table: story_metrics
CREATE TABLE story_metrics (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    story_id TEXT NOT NULL,  -- e.g., "US-015"
    story_title TEXT NOT NULL,

    -- Time estimation
    estimated_min_days REAL,  -- e.g., 3.0
    estimated_max_days REAL,  -- e.g., 5.0
    actual_days REAL,         -- e.g., 4.2

    -- Timestamps
    started_at TIMESTAMP,
    completed_at TIMESTAMP,

    -- Calculation fields
    estimation_error_days REAL,  -- actual - avg(estimated)
    estimation_accuracy_pct REAL,  -- 100 - abs(error/estimated * 100)

    -- Context
    complexity TEXT,  -- "low", "medium", "high"
    category TEXT,    -- "feature", "bug", "refactor", "docs"
    story_points INTEGER,

    -- Technical spec phase metrics (JSON) - tracks spec-level estimates
    spec_phase_metrics TEXT,  -- JSON: [{"phase": "Phase 1", "estimated_hours": 6, "actual_hours": 8, "accuracy_pct": 75}, ...]
    has_technical_spec BOOLEAN DEFAULT 0,
    technical_spec_path TEXT,  -- e.g., "docs/US-015_TECHNICAL_SPEC.md"

    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

-- Index for fast queries
CREATE INDEX idx_story_completed ON story_metrics(completed_at);
CREATE INDEX idx_story_id ON story_metrics(story_id);

-- New table: velocity_snapshots (weekly/sprint velocity tracking)
CREATE TABLE velocity_snapshots (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    period_start DATE,
    period_end DATE,

    -- Velocity metrics
    stories_completed INTEGER,
    story_points_completed INTEGER,
    total_days_actual REAL,

    -- Estimation accuracy for this period
    avg_estimation_accuracy_pct REAL,

    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
```

**Acceptance Criteria** (Definition of Done):

**Data Capture**:
- [ ] When user story is created, store estimated time (min/max days) from ROADMAP
- [ ] When technical spec exists, store spec phase estimates (e.g., "Phase 1: 6h")
- [ ] When user story status changes to "In Progress", record `started_at` timestamp
- [ ] When user story marked complete, record `completed_at` timestamp
- [ ] When spec phase completes, record actual time for that phase
- [ ] Calculate actual days taken (completed_at - started_at, excluding weekends/breaks)
- [ ] Calculate estimation error and accuracy percentage (story-level AND spec-level)
- [ ] Store all metrics in SQLite `story_metrics` table with spec phase details

**Metrics Display in /status**:
- [ ] `/status` command shows current sprint velocity
- [ ] Shows recent estimation accuracy (last 5 user stories)
- [ ] Shows velocity trend (improving/stable/declining)
- [ ] Shows current active story with elapsed time

**Detailed Metrics Command**:
- [ ] `/metrics` command shows comprehensive historical data
- [ ] List all completed user stories with estimated vs actual time
- [ ] Show overall estimation accuracy (% within ±20% of estimate)
- [ ] Show velocity over time (chart or table)
- [ ] Show accuracy trend (improving/declining)

**Estimation Improvement**:
- [ ] When PM estimates new user story, suggest adjusted estimate based on:
  - Historical accuracy for similar complexity/category
  - Recent velocity trends
  - Team capacity
- [ ] Show confidence level in suggestion ("based on 10 similar stories")

**Real-Time Tracking**:
- [ ] Track when user story starts (status → "In Progress")
- [ ] Track when each phase completes (optional, for detailed analysis)
- [ ] Update metrics when user story marked complete

**Velocity Calculation**:
- [ ] Calculate weekly velocity (stories completed per week)
- [ ] Calculate story points velocity (if using story points)
- [ ] Store velocity snapshots for trend analysis

**Reporting**:
- [ ] Generate sprint/week retrospective report with:
  - Stories completed
  - Velocity
  - Estimation accuracy
  - Insights (e.g., "Backend work consistently takes 30% longer than estimated")

**Implementation Approach**:

**Phase 1: Database Schema & Data Capture** (Day 1 - 4 hours)
1. Create `story_metrics` table in SQLite
2. Create `velocity_snapshots` table
3. Implement data capture on user story lifecycle events:
   - When created: capture estimated time
   - When started: capture `started_at`
   - When completed: capture `completed_at`, calculate metrics
4. Write tests for metric calculation

**Phase 2: /status Integration** (Day 2 - 3 hours)
1. Query current velocity from database
2. Calculate recent estimation accuracy
3. Add velocity/accuracy display to `/status` command
4. Show current active story with elapsed time

**Phase 3: /metrics Command** (Day 2-3 - 4 hours)
1. Implement `/metrics` command
2. Query historical data from database
3. Display formatted table/chart of:
   - All user stories with estimated vs actual
   - Overall accuracy statistics
   - Velocity over time
4. Add filtering options (by date range, category, complexity)

**Phase 4: Estimation Suggestions** (Day 3 - 3 hours)
1. When PM creates new user story, analyze historical data
2. Find similar user stories (by complexity, category)
3. Calculate suggested estimate based on historical actuals
4. Display suggestion with confidence level
5. PM can override suggestion

**Phase 5: Reporting & Visualization** (Day 4 - 4 hours)
1. Generate retrospective reports
2. Velocity trend chart (ASCII or export to CSV)
3. Accuracy trend over time
4. Insights generation (identify patterns)

**Phase 6: Testing & Documentation** (Day 4-5 - 2 hours)
1. End-to-end testing with real user stories
2. Update documentation
3. Add examples to TUTORIALS.md
4. Mark US-015 complete

**Technical Foundation**:
- SQLite database (already in use at `data/notifications.db` or new `data/metrics.db`)
- RoadmapEditor - Can parse user story estimated time
- CLI commands infrastructure - Can add new `/metrics` command
- Timestamp tracking - Python datetime

**Estimated Effort**: 3-4 days (database, metrics calculation, display, estimation suggestions)

**Priority**: MEDIUM-HIGH (valuable for planning, but US-014 is more critical)

**Example Scenarios**:

**Scenario 1: Capturing Metrics for Completed User Story (with Technical Spec)**
```
# ROADMAP.md before completion:
**Status**: 🔄 In Progress
**Estimated Effort**: 3-5 days

# Technical spec (US-014_TECHNICAL_SPEC.md) has phase estimates:
Phase 1: 6 hours
Phase 2: 4 hours
Phase 3: 6 hours
Phase 4: 8 hours
Total: 24 hours (3 days)

# User marks US-014 complete
PM detects completion:
- Started: 2025-10-10 09:00
- Completed: 2025-10-13 17:00
- Actual: 4.3 days (34.4 hours)
- Estimated (ROADMAP): 3-5 days (avg: 4.0 days)
- Estimated (Spec): 3.0 days (24 hours)
- Error (ROADMAP): +0.3 days (+7.5%)
- Error (Spec): +1.3 days (+43%)
- Accuracy (ROADMAP): 92.5% (within ±20%)
- Accuracy (Spec): 57% (spec underestimated)

    {"phase": "Phase 4", "estimated_hours": 8, "actual_hours": 12.4, "accuracy_pct": 65}
  ],
  ...
}

# Insights generated:
- ROADMAP estimate was good (92.5% accuracy)

## ✅ COMPLETE: US-016 - Detailed Technical Spec Generation with Task-Level Estimates

**Project**: **📐 US-016 - PM Must Create Full Technical Specs Before Estimating Delivery**

**Status**: ✅ **COMPLETE** - All 6 Phases COMPLETE (2025-10-16)
**Test Coverage**: 100 tests passing (unit + integration)
**Production Ready**: Yes

**User Story**:
> "As a project_manager I need the technical full specification to be already written with estimated time for each task, to give an estimated time delivery."

**Business Context**:
Currently, PM can provide delivery estimates without creating detailed technical specifications. This leads to:
- ❌ Inaccurate estimates (missing hidden complexity)
- ❌ Scope creep (discovered tasks not estimated)
- ❌ No task-level breakdown for tracking
- ❌ Difficult to identify which parts take longer

**The Problem This Solves**:
This is both a **capability** (tools to generate detailed specs) and a **process rule** (PM must refuse to estimate without spec).

**What Needs to Happen**:

**1. Mandatory Process Rule** (COLLABORATION_METHODOLOGY.md):
PM **MUST** create a full technical specification with task-level time estimates before providing any delivery date estimate to the user.

If user asks "How long will this take?", PM **MUST** respond:
- "I need to create a technical specification first to give you an accurate estimate."
- Then PM creates the spec
- Then PM provides the delivery estimate based on spec totals

**2. Technical Spec Requirements** (what PM must include):
```markdown
## Technical Specification Structure

### Phase Breakdown:
Each phase must include:
- Phase name and goal
- Task list with time estimates
- Dependencies
- Risks
- Success criteria

Example:
**Phase 1: Database Schema** (Total: 6 hours)
- [ ] Design tables (1.5h)
- [ ] Write migration scripts (2h)
- [ ] Add indexes (1h)
- [ ] Write tests for schema (1.5h)

**Phase 2: API Implementation** (Total: 8 hours)
- [ ] Create endpoint routes (2h)
- [ ] Implement business logic (3h)
- [ ] Add error handling (1h)
- [ ] Write integration tests (2h)

Total Estimated Time: 14 hours (1.75 days)
```

**3. Spec Generation Capability** (what to build):
Build tools to help PM generate these detailed specs more efficiently:
- Template system for common feature types
- AI-assisted task breakdown
- Historical data integration (similar features)
- Auto-calculation of totals

**Acceptance Criteria** (Definition of Done):

**Process Rule (Methodology)**:
- [ ] COLLABORATION_METHODOLOGY.md updated with mandatory spec rule
- [ ] PM cannot provide delivery estimate without spec
- [ ] PM must refuse: "I need to create a technical specification first"
- [ ] Rule documented with examples

**Spec Structure Requirements**:
- [ ] Technical spec template includes task-level breakdown
- [ ] Each task has time estimate (in hours)
- [ ] Phases are clearly defined with totals
- [ ] Dependencies between tasks are documented
- [ ] Risks are identified per phase

**Generation Capability**:
- [ ] Template system for technical specs
- [ ] AI-assisted task breakdown from user story
- [ ] Auto-calculation of phase totals and overall delivery time
- [ ] Integration with US-015 metrics (suggest estimates based on historical data)

**Delivery Estimate Process**:
- [ ] User approves user story first
- [ ] PM creates detailed technical spec (task-level estimates)
- [ ] PM calculates total delivery time from spec
- [ ] PM provides delivery estimate to user
- [ ] User approves spec before implementation starts

**Quality Requirements**:
- [ ] Task estimates at reasonable granularity (0.5h - 4h per task)
- [ ] No "misc" or "other" tasks without detail
- [ ] Testing time explicitly included
- [ ] Documentation time explicitly included

**Implementation Approach**:

**Phase 1: Methodology Update** ✅ COMPLETE (2025-10-16 - 2 hours)
1. ✅ Update COLLABORATION_METHODOLOGY.md Section 2.4
2. ✅ Add mandatory spec-before-estimate rule
3. ✅ Document the process flow
4. ✅ Add examples of PM refusing to estimate without spec (2 examples)
5. ✅ Cross-reference US-016
6. ✅ Update Definition of Done section (6.2) with spec requirement

**Deliverables**:

**Next**: Phase 3 - AI-Assisted Task Breakdown (8 hours)

**Phase 3: AI-Assisted Task Breakdown** (Day 2-3 - 8 hours)
1. Implement task breakdown logic in AIService
2. Given user story, generate list of tasks
3. Suggest time estimates based on:
   - Task complexity
   - Historical data (US-015 metrics)
   - Similar features
4. Group tasks into logical phases
5. Calculate totals automatically

**Phase 4: Integration with Estimation Metrics** (Day 3 - 4 hours)

2. Query historical task estimates vs actuals
3. Adjust suggested estimates based on accuracy trends
4. Show confidence level in estimates

**Phase 5: Spec Generation Workflow** (Day 4 - 6 hours)
1. When user approves user story, PM triggers spec generation
2. PM uses AI to break down into tasks
3. PM generates spec document with estimates
4. PM calculates total delivery time
5. PM shows delivery estimate to user with spec reference

**Phase 6: Testing & Documentation** (Day 4-5 - 4 hours)
1. Test spec generation for various feature types
2. Validate task estimates are reasonable
3. Update documentation (TUTORIALS.md with examples)
4. Mark US-016 complete

**Technical Foundation**:
- Template system - Jinja2 or similar for spec templates
- AIService - Can analyze user stories and generate task lists
- US-015 integration - Access to historical metrics
- File system - Create and manage spec documents
- COLLABORATION_METHODOLOGY.md - Document the mandatory process

**Estimated Effort**: 4-5 days (methodology update, templates, AI task breakdown, integration)

**Priority**: HIGH (critical for accurate estimation and avoiding scope creep)

**Example Scenarios**:

**Scenario 1: User Asks for Estimate Without Spec**
```
User: "How long will the Slack integration feature take?"

PM (OLD behavior - not allowed):
"Probably 3-4 days"

PM (NEW behavior - US-016):
"I need to create a technical specification first to give you an accurate estimate.

This will take me about 15 minutes to analyze the requirements and break down
the tasks with time estimates.

Should I proceed with creating the spec?"

User: "Yes"

PM: [Generates detailed spec with task breakdown]

PM: "I've created a technical specification at docs/US-017_TECHNICAL_SPEC.md

Based on the detailed task breakdown:

**Phase 1: Slack API Setup** (4 hours)
- Configure Slack app (1h)
- Set up OAuth flow (1.5h)
- Test connection (0.5h)
- Write integration tests (1h)

**Phase 2: Notification Implementation** (6 hours)
- Create notification formatter (2h)
- Implement send logic (2h)
- Add error handling & retries (1h)
- Write unit tests (1h)

**Phase 3: Integration & Testing** (4 hours)
- Integrate with existing notification system (2h)
- End-to-end testing (1h)
- Documentation (1h)

**Total Estimated Delivery Time**: 14 hours (1.75 days)

With current velocity (2 stories/week), I estimate delivery in 2-3 days including
testing and documentation.

Would you like to review the technical spec before I proceed?"
```

**Scenario 2: PM Generates Spec from User Story**
```
User: "Add a /metrics command to show estimation accuracy"

PM: "I'll create a technical specification for the metrics command feature.

[AI analyzes user story]
[Breaks down into tasks]
[Suggests estimates based on historical data]

Generated technical spec at docs/US-018_TECHNICAL_SPEC.md:

**Phase 1: Database Query Logic** (3 hours)
- Query story_metrics table (1h)
- Calculate accuracy statistics (1h)
- Format data for display (1h)

**Phase 2: CLI Command Implementation** (4 hours)
- Create /metrics command handler (1.5h)
- Format output table (ASCII) (1.5h)
- Add filtering options (1h)

**Phase 3: Testing & Documentation** (3 hours)
- Unit tests (1.5h)
- Integration tests (1h)
- Update TUTORIALS.md (0.5h)

**Total**: 10 hours (1.25 days)

**Confidence**: High (based on 5 similar CLI command implementations)
**Historical Accuracy**: 88% for CLI features

Estimated delivery: 1-2 days"
```

**Scenario 3: PM Refuses to Estimate Without Spec**
```
User: "Can you give me a rough estimate for the IDE integration feature?"

PM: "I need to create a technical specification first to give you an accurate estimate.

Without a detailed spec, any estimate would be a guess and could be off by 2-3x.

The IDE integration feature is complex with many unknowns:
- Which IDEs to support?
- LSP server implementation needed?
- Integration with existing code_developer knowledge?
- Real-time vs on-demand completion?

I can create a technical spec in about 30 minutes that will give us a much more
accurate delivery estimate.

Should I proceed with the spec creation?"

User: "Yes, go ahead"

PM: [Creates detailed spec with all tasks and estimates]
```

**Database Schema** (extends US-015):
```sql
-- Add to story_metrics table
ALTER TABLE story_metrics ADD COLUMN has_detailed_spec BOOLEAN DEFAULT 0;
ALTER TABLE story_metrics ADD COLUMN spec_task_count INTEGER;
ALTER TABLE story_metrics ADD COLUMN spec_generated_by TEXT; -- "manual" or "ai-assisted"

-- New table: spec_tasks (tracks individual task estimates)
CREATE TABLE spec_tasks (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    story_id TEXT NOT NULL,
    phase_name TEXT NOT NULL,
    task_name TEXT NOT NULL,
    estimated_hours REAL,
    actual_hours REAL,
    completed BOOLEAN DEFAULT 0,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
```

**Relationship to Other User Stories**:
- **US-015**: Provides historical data for better task estimates
- **US-014**: Helps categorize spec requirements (feature vs methodology)
- **US-010**: Specs become part of living documentation
- **Section 2.4 COLLABORATION_METHODOLOGY.md**: Enforces spec-before-implementation rule

**Future Enhancements** (not in scope):
- Visual spec generation UI
- Gantt chart generation from spec
- Spec comparison (estimated vs actual for learning)
- Automatic spec updates as implementation progresses

### **Technical Approach**

**1. StatusReportGenerator Class**:
```python
class StatusReportGenerator:
    """Generates executive summaries and calendar reports from ROADMAP data"""

    def __init__(self, roadmap_path: str):
        self.roadmap_path = roadmap_path
        self.roadmap_editor = RoadmapEditor(roadmap_path)

    def get_recent_completions(self, days: int = 14) -> List[Dict]:
        """Get completed user stories from last N days"""
        # Parse ROADMAP for completed stories
        # Filter by completion date (last N days)
        # Extract: ID, title, completion date, business value, key features
        pass

    def format_executive_summary(self, completions: List[Dict]) -> str:
        """Format recent completions as executive summary"""
        # Business value + key features (not technical details)
        pass

    def get_upcoming_deliverables(self, count: int = 3) -> List[Dict]:
        """Get next N priorities with estimates"""
        # Parse ROADMAP for priorities with estimates
        # Exclude items without estimates
        # Extract: ID, title, estimated days, what, impact
        pass

    def format_calendar_report(self, deliverables: List[Dict]) -> str:
        """Format upcoming deliverables as text-based prose report"""
        # Calculate estimated completion dates
        # Format as prose (not just list)
        pass

    def generate_status_tracking_doc(self) -> str:
        """Generate docs/STATUS_TRACKING.md for internal use"""
        # Technical details for PM/developer
        # Actual vs estimated, velocity, files changed, etc.
        pass

    def should_auto_update(self) -> bool:
        """Check if auto-update is due (3 days elapsed or estimates changed)"""
        pass
```

**2. Chat Commands**:
```python
# In project-manager CLI

@chat_command
def summary(self, args: str = ""):
    """Show summary of recently completed user stories

    Usage:
        /summary          - Show recent completions (last 14 days)
        /summary update   - Force regenerate summary now
    """
    generator = StatusReportGenerator("docs/ROADMAP.md")
    completions = generator.get_recent_completions(days=14)
    summary = generator.format_executive_summary(completions)
    self.display(summary)

@chat_command
def calendar(self, args: str = ""):
    """Show calendar of upcoming deliverables with estimates

    Usage:
        /calendar         - Show top 3 priorities with estimates
        /calendar 5       - Show top 5 priorities
        /calendar update  - Force regenerate calendar now
    """
    count = int(args) if args.isdigit() else 3
    generator = StatusReportGenerator("docs/ROADMAP.md")
    deliverables = generator.get_upcoming_deliverables(count=count)
    calendar = generator.format_calendar_report(deliverables)
    self.display(calendar)
```

**3. Auto-Update Scheduler**:
```python
class AutoUpdateScheduler:
    """Schedules automatic summary/calendar updates every 3 days"""

    def __init__(self):
        self.last_update = self.load_last_update_timestamp()

    def should_update(self) -> bool:
        """Check if 3 days have elapsed since last update"""
        return (datetime.now() - self.last_update).days >= 3

    def check_estimate_changes(self) -> bool:
        """Check if any estimates changed by >1 day"""
        # Compare current estimates with last known estimates
        pass

    def trigger_update(self):
        """Generate and send update to user"""
        generator = StatusReportGenerator("docs/ROADMAP.md")
        summary = generator.format_executive_summary(...)
        calendar = generator.format_calendar_report(...)
        self.notify_user(summary, calendar)
        self.last_update = datetime.now()
```

### **Example Scenarios**

**Scenario 1: User Wants to Add Feature**

```
User: "I want email notifications when daemon completes tasks"

[PM detects request type: feature]
[Proactive guidance triggered]

PM: "I detected this as a feature request. Based on Section 5.1 of our
     methodology, here's what I'll do:

     1. Create a user story in ROADMAP.md
     2. Ask clarifying questions about scope
     3. Estimate effort
     4. Get your approval

     Should I proceed with creating the user story?"

User: "/my-role"

PM: "🎯 Your Role: User (Product Owner)

     📋 Key Responsibilities:
     • Define what needs to be built (like this email notification feature)
     • Make product decisions (approve/reject my proposals)
     • Approve technical specifications
     • Validate completed work

     ⚡ Your Authorities:
     • Final say on feature scope
     • Can change priorities anytime
     • Can request changes

     For this request, you should:
     1. Confirm you want me to create the user story
     2. Answer my clarifying questions
     3. Approve the final user story

     Ready to proceed?"

User: "yes"
```

**Scenario 2: PM Uncertain About Categorization**

```
User: "I need better documentation"

[PM detects ambiguous request]
[Proactive guidance triggered]

PM: "I want to make sure I understand correctly.

     This could be either:
     A) A feature request - build auto-generated documentation
        → I'll add to ROADMAP.md
     B) A process change - change how I document things
        → I'll update COLLABORATION_METHODOLOGY.md
     C) Both - build feature AND change process
        → I'll update both documents

     Need help deciding? Type '/help categorization' for examples."

User: "/help categorization"

PM: "📖 Request Categorization Help

     Based on COLLABORATION_METHODOLOGY.md Section 3.2.1:

     Feature Indicators:
     • 'I want', 'add', 'build', 'implement'
     • Describes something to create

     Methodology Indicators:
     • 'PM should', 'always', 'process'
     • Describes how we work

     Your request 'I need better documentation' could be either!

     Examples:
     • 'Auto-generate API docs' → Feature (build tool)
     • 'Document every feature in README' → Methodology (process)
     • 'Build doc generator AND mandate doc updates' → Both

     Which applies to your request?"

User: "Auto-generate docs"

PM: "Got it! Feature request. I'll create a user story in ROADMAP.md."
```

**Scenario 3: User Unsure What to Do Next**

```
User: "/what-next"

PM: "📋 Suggested Next Actions (Your Role: Product Owner)

     1. ⭐ HIGH PRIORITY: Review US-014 technical spec
        Rationale: Developer is waiting for your approval to start
        Time: 15-20 minutes
        Action: Read docs/US-014_TECHNICAL_SPEC.md and approve

     2. 🔔 RESPONSE NEEDED: Daemon asked a question (Notification #42)
        Rationale: Blocking developer's progress on US-015
        Question: 'Use SQLite or PostgreSQL for metrics?'
        Time: 2 minutes
        Action: Type '/notifications' to view and respond

     3. ✅ VALIDATION: Test completed US-013 feature
        Rationale: Feature marked complete, needs user validation
        Time: 10-15 minutes
        Action: Test '/US' command and provide feedback

     4. 📝 PLANNING: Review ROADMAP priorities
        Rationale: US-014 nearing completion, need next priority
        Time: 5 minutes
        Action: Decide if US-015 or US-016 should be next

     5. 💬 FEEDBACK: Provide feedback on documentation (optional)
        Rationale: US-010 created new docs, user input valuable
        Time: 10 minutes
        Action: Review TUTORIALS.md and suggest improvements

     My recommendation: Start with #1 (unblocking developer) then #2
     (respond to question). This keeps work flowing.

     Want more details on any action? Ask 'Why #1?' or similar."

User: "Why #1?"

PM: "⭐ Why Review US-014 Spec (Priority #1):

     Context:
     • Developer created 300-line technical spec for US-014
     • Spec defines how intelligent request categorization will work
     • Developer cannot start coding until you approve
     • Estimated 3-5 days of work once approved

     Impact of Delay:
     • Developer is idle waiting for your approval
     • Estimated velocity loss: 1 day per day of delay
     • Other work (US-015, US-016) also blocked on this

     What to Look For:
     • Does the scope match what you requested?
     • Are acceptance criteria clear and testable?
     • Do you understand the technical approach?
     • Any concerns about complexity or timeline?

     Approval Process (Section 5.3):
     1. Read docs/US-014_TECHNICAL_SPEC.md (15-20 min)
     2. Type 'approved' or ask questions
     3. Developer starts Phase 1 implementation

     Reference: COLLABORATION_METHODOLOGY.md Section 5.3 (Implementing a Priority)"

**Status**: 📝 **PLANNED** (Created 2025-10-10)

**User Story**:
> "As a user I want to be notified about the delivery that was under progress is now ready to ship. Therefore we need user demo and user tests"

**Business Context**:
When a user story is complete and ready for user validation, the user needs:
1. **Notification** that delivery is ready (via GitHub PR notification)
2. **Demo guide** in the PR showing exactly how to test
3. **Complete walkthrough** with commands, expected results, acceptance criteria verification, edge cases, and troubleshooting

This ensures the user can efficiently demo and test deliveries without asking "How do I test this?" or "What should I look for?"

**User's Clarifications**:
- Notification: Use GitHub's native notifications (no custom notification system)
- Trigger: Developer completes → PM validates DoD → **Then** PR opened → GitHub notifies user
- PR Content: Full demo guide (acceptance criteria + test time + files changed + step-by-step instructions)
- Demo Instructions: Commands + expected results + acceptance criteria verification + edge cases + troubleshooting

**Business Value**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (Critical - Enables efficient user validation)
**Estimated Effort**: 2-3 days (1-2 days for PR generator, 0.5-1 day for templates, 0.5 day for testing)

### Troubleshooting

**Issue**: Documentation links are broken
**Solution**: All links use relative paths like `[ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md)`. Check that files exist in `docs/` directory.

**Issue**: Tutorial examples don't work
**Solution**: Ensure you're in project root directory and poetry environment is activated: `poetry shell`

**Issue**: Can't find DOCUMENTATION_INDEX.md
**Solution**: File is located at `docs/DOCUMENTATION_INDEX.md`. Use `cd docs && ls` to verify.

## 📝 PLANNED: US-020 - Conversational Project Manager Interaction

**User Story**:
> "As a user, I want the project_manager to interact with me conversationally (like we did in this session), so that creating user stories feels natural and collaborative instead of rigid and command-driven."

**Context**:
This user story was inspired by an actual session where the user and PM collaborated naturally to create US-018 and US-019. The interaction felt collaborative, adaptive, and human - not robotic or interrogative.

**Key Insight**:
> "The kind of way we talked to each other during This Session is exactly what I would expect from project_manager."

---

### **Problem Statement**

Currently, when users initiate a new user story, the interaction can feel:
- ❌ Robotic ("Please answer questions 1-6")
- ❌ Inflexible (all questions at once, no adaptation)
- ❌ One-directional (PM asks, user answers, no dialogue)
- ❌ Disconnected (no confirmation of understanding)

**What we want instead**:
- ✅ Natural, collaborative flow
- ✅ Adaptive questioning (reconsider questions when user corrects)
- ✅ One-by-one questions (not overwhelming batches)
- ✅ Clear confirmation (show draft before proceeding)

---

### **Scope**

**When This Applies**:
- User initiates a new user story ("user story: As a [role] I want [goal]...")
- PM needs to gather requirements through clarifying questions

**Conversational Behaviors**:

1. **One-by-One Questioning**
   - Always ask questions individually
   - Wait for user response before asking next question
   - Never batch multiple questions ("Question 1-6: ...")

2. **Adaptive Questioning**
   - When user corrects/clarifies mid-conversation, reconsider remaining questions
   - Example: User says "sorry the real story is..." → PM pivots to ask different questions
   - Preserve answers that still apply to corrected story
   - Discard questions that are no longer relevant

3. **Always Integrate User Input**
   - User's words have authority (even if they affect priorities or code_developer work)
   - Never hesitate or ask permission to integrate corrections
   - Immediately accept clarifications and adjust approach

4. **Clear Confirmation**
   - After gathering all answers, show user story draft for approval
   - Don't proceed to ROADMAP.md until user approves draft

5. **Natural Flow**
   - Conversation feels collaborative, not interrogative
   - Avoid robotic language ("Please answer questions 1-6")
   - Use conversational transitions ("Perfect! Let me ask...", "Got it! Next question...")

### **Implementation**

#### **Phase 1: Conversation State Manager** (1-1.5 days)

**New Component**: `ConversationStateManager`

```python
class ConversationStateManager:
    """Manages conversational state during user story creation.

        pass

    def generate_draft_user_story(self) -> str:
        """Generate user story specification draft for user approval."""
        # Combine user_story_text + all answers into structured spec
        pass
```

#### **Phase 2: One-by-One Question Flow** (0.5-1 day)

**Modify**: `project_manager chat` command to use conversational flow

**Current Behavior** (Batch Questions):
```
PM: I have 5 questions to clarify your user story:

Question 1: What should happen when...?
Question 2: Who will use this feature?
Question 3: What's the success criteria?
Question 4: Are there any edge cases?
Question 5: What's the priority?

Please answer all 5 questions.
```

**New Behavior** (One-by-One):
```
PM: Let me ask some clarifying questions to understand your user story better.

PM: Question 1: What should happen when...?
User: [answer]

PM: Got it! Next question: Who will use this feature?
User: [answer]

PM: Perfect! Question 3: What's the success criteria?
User: [answer]

[... continues one-by-one ...]

PM: Great! I have all the information I need. Let me show you the draft user story:

**Tasks**:
- Implement one-by-one question flow (3h)
- Add conversational transitions (1h)
- Implement correction detection (2h)
- Add natural acknowledgments (1h)
- Write integration tests (2h)

**Total**: 9 hours (~1 day)

---

#### **Phase 3: Draft Approval Workflow** (0.5 day)

**After all questions answered**, show user story draft and wait for approval:

```
PM: Great! I have all the information I need. Here's the user story draft:

════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
## 📝 US-XXX - [Title]

**User Story**:
> "[Original user story text]"

**Scope**:
[Generated from answers]

**Acceptance Criteria**:
1. [Criterion 1 - from answer to question X]
2. [Criterion 2 - from answer to question Y]
...

**Implementation Plan**:
- Phase 1: [...]
- Phase 2: [...]

**Estimated Effort**: X-Y days
**Business Value**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

Does this match what you had in mind?

Options:
- "yes" / "approve" → I'll add this to ROADMAP.md
- "no" / "changes needed" → Tell me what to adjust
- "cancel" → Discard this user story
```

**Implementation**:
```python
def _show_draft_for_approval(self, draft: str):
    """Show draft user story and wait for approval."""
    self.send_message("Great! I have all the information I need. Here's the user story draft:\n")

```

**Tasks**:
- Implement draft display formatting (2h)
- Add approval detection (1h)
- Handle "changes needed" workflow (2h)
- Write tests (1h)

**Total**: 6 hours (~0.5 day)

---

#### **Phase 4: Anti-Pattern Detection** (0.5 day)

Ensure PM never exhibits robotic behavior:

**Anti-Patterns to Avoid**:
❌ "Please answer questions 1-6"
❌ "Q1: [question] Q2: [question] Q3: [question]"
❌ No transitions between questions
❌ No acknowledgment of answers
❌ Asking redundant questions after user clarified

**Implementation**:
```python
class ConversationalToneEnforcer:
    """Ensures PM uses conversational tone, not robotic."""

    ROBOTIC_PATTERNS = [
        r"please answer questions? \d+-\d+",
        r"q\d+:",
        r"question \d+.*question \d+",  # Multiple questions at once
    ]

    CONVERSATIONAL_TRANSITIONS = [
        "Got it! ",
        "Perfect! ",
        "Excellent! ",
        "Great! ",
        "I understand. ",
    ]

    def validate_message(self, message: str) -> bool:
        """Check if message violates conversational tone."""
        for pattern in self.ROBOTIC_PATTERNS:
            if re.search(pattern, message.lower()):
                raise ValueError(f"Robotic tone detected: {pattern}")
        return True

    def add_transition(self, message: str, question_idx: int) -> str:
        """Add conversational transition to question."""
        if question_idx == 0:
            return f"Let me ask some clarifying questions.\n\n{message}"
        else:
            transition = random.choice(self.CONVERSATIONAL_TRANSITIONS)
            return f"{transition}{message}"
```

**Tasks**:
- Implement anti-pattern detection (2h)
- Add conversational transitions (1h)
- Add tone validation in unit tests (2h)

**Total**: 5 hours (~0.5 day)

---

#### **Phase 5: Integration & Testing** (1 day)

**Integration**:
- Integrate ConversationStateManager into project_manager chat
- Update chat command to detect new user story intent
- Add session persistence for in-progress conversations

**Testing Scenarios**:

**Test 1: Simple User Story (No Corrections)**
```
User: user story: As a developer I want syntax highlighting in code blocks
PM: Let me ask some clarifying questions.
PM: Question 1: What programming languages should be highlighted?
User: Python, JavaScript, and Bash
PM: Got it! Question 2: Where should this highlighting appear?
User: In the chat interface
PM: Perfect! [... continues ...]
PM: [Shows draft]
User: yes
PM: ✅ Added to ROADMAP.md!
```

**Test 2: User Correction Mid-Conversation**
```
User: user story: As a pm I want to see branches related to what I document
PM: Question 1: What information do you need from branches?
PM: Question 2: How should branches be displayed?
User: sorry the real story is: As a user I want to be notified when a delivery is ready to ship
PM: Ah, I understand now! Let me adjust my questions based on that.
PM: Question 1: What notifications do you want to receive?
User: When PR is opened
PM: Got it! [... continues with different questions ...]
```

**Test 3: User Requests Changes to Draft**
```
PM: [Shows draft]
User: no, changes needed
PM: What would you like me to adjust?
User: The acceptance criteria should include edge cases
PM: [Updates draft with edge cases]
PM: [Shows updated draft]
User: yes
PM: ✅ Added to ROADMAP.md!
```

**Tasks**:
- Write end-to-end test scenarios (4h)
- Manual testing with real user stories (3h)
- Fix bugs and refine tone (4h)
- Documentation and examples (2h)

**Total**: 13 hours (~1.5 day)

---

#### **Phase 6: Documentation & Methodology Update** (0.5 day)

**Update COLLABORATION_METHODOLOGY.md**:

Add **Section 4.5: Conversational Interaction Patterns** (200-300 lines):

```markdown
### Section 4.5: Conversational Interaction Patterns

When users initiate a new user story, the PM uses a conversational interaction style
designed to feel collaborative and natural, not robotic or interrogative.

**Conversational Principles**:

1. **One-by-One Questions** - Never batch questions
2. **Adaptive to Corrections** - Reconsider questions when user clarifies
3. **Always Integrate User Input** - User has authority over requirements
4. **Clear Confirmation** - Show draft before proceeding
5. **Natural Flow** - Conversational tone, not robotic

**Example Interaction**:
[Show complete example from Test 2 above]

**Anti-Patterns to Avoid**:
- ❌ "Please answer questions 1-6"
- ❌ Asking redundant questions after clarification
- ❌ No acknowledgment between questions
- ❌ Proceeding without showing draft

**Success Criteria**:
✅ Conversation feels collaborative, not interrogative
✅ User feels heard and understood
✅ Questions are relevant and adaptive
✅ Draft matches user's intent on first try (>85% approval rate)
```

**Tasks**:
- Write Section 4.5 in COLLABORATION_METHODOLOGY.md (3h)
- Add examples from testing (1h)
- Cross-reference with Section 3.1 (User role) (1h)
- Version bump to 1.9 (15 min)

**Total**: 5 hours (~0.5 day)

---

### **Acceptance Criteria**

**Conversational Flow** (6 criteria):

1. ✅ **One-by-One Questions**
   - PM asks questions individually, never in batches
   - Waits for user response before asking next question
   - Test: User creates new story → PM asks Q1 → waits → asks Q2 → waits

2. ✅ **Adaptive to Corrections**
   - When user corrects/clarifies, PM reconsiders remaining questions
   - PM preserves relevant answers from before correction
   - Test: User says "sorry the real story is..." → PM asks different questions

3. ✅ **Always Integrates User Input**
   - PM accepts user corrections immediately without hesitation
   - Changes take effect even if they affect priorities/code_developer
   - Test: User changes scope mid-conversation → PM adapts without asking permission

4. ✅ **Clear Confirmation via Draft**
   - After gathering answers, PM shows complete draft user story
   - PM waits for user approval ("yes"/"no"/"changes") before adding to ROADMAP
   - Test: PM shows draft → User says "no" → PM asks what to adjust

5. ✅ **Natural Flow**
   - Conversation feels collaborative, not interrogative
   - Conversational transitions between questions ("Got it!", "Perfect!")
   - Test: Read conversation transcript → feels natural to human reviewer

6. ✅ **Anti-Pattern Prevention**
   - PM never uses robotic language ("Please answer questions 1-6")
   - PM never asks redundant questions after user clarifies
   - Test: Automated check detects robotic patterns → test fails

**Technical Implementation** (3 criteria):

7. ✅ **ConversationStateManager**
   - Tracks current question, answers, corrections
   - Regenerates questions when user corrects
   - Test: Unit tests verify state management

8. ✅ **Correction Detection**
   - Detects when user is correcting ("sorry", "actually", "I meant")
   - Triggers question regeneration automatically
   - Test: User says "actually..." → PM detects correction

9. ✅ **Session Persistence**
   - In-progress conversation survives if user disconnects/reconnects
   - PM resumes from current question
   - Test: Start conversation → disconnect → reconnect → PM resumes

**Documentation** (2 criteria):

10. ✅ **COLLABORATION_METHODOLOGY.md Updated**
    - Section 4.5 added with conversational patterns
    - Examples from testing included
    - Version bumped to 1.9

11. ✅ **User Validation**
    - User tests new conversational flow with real user story
    - User confirms it feels "natural and collaborative"
    - 85%+ approval rate on first-try draft

---

### **Success Criteria**

**Primary Goal**: Natural, collaborative flow

**Metrics**:
- Conversation feels collaborative, not interrogative (subjective - user feedback)
- Questions are relevant and not redundant
- Draft matches user intent on first try (>85% approval rate)

**User Feedback**:
> "The kind of way we talked to each other during This Session is exactly what I would expect from project_manager."

---

### **Estimated Effort**

**Implementation**: 4-5 days
- Phase 1: Conversation State Manager (1-1.5 days)
- Phase 2: One-by-One Question Flow (0.5-1 day)
- Phase 3: Draft Approval Workflow (0.5 day)
- Phase 4: Anti-Pattern Detection (0.5 day)
- Phase 5: Integration & Testing (1 day)
- Phase 6: Documentation (0.5 day)

**Business Value**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ Critical
- Improves user experience dramatically
- Makes PM feel human, not robotic
- Reduces friction in user story creation
- Higher quality specs (better questions → better answers)

**Priority**: HIGH (This is how PM should ALWAYS interact with users)

---

### **Relationships to Other User Stories**

**Depends On**:
- US-006 (Chat UX) - Conversational flow requires interactive chat
- Section 3.1 (User role) - User responsibilities during user story creation

**Enables**:
- US-021 (PM Introspection) - Conversational data feeds into metrics
- Better user story quality (clear questions → clear requirements)

**Related Methodology Sections**:
- Section 3.1.6 (Example Interactions) - Shows conversational patterns
- Section 4.4 (Progress Reporting) - Conversational tone applies there too
- Section 2.7 (Code References Methodology) - PM behavior matches documented patterns

---

### **Example: Full Conversational Flow**

**Scenario**: User wants email notifications

```
User: user story: As a developer I want email notifications when the daemon completes tasks

PM: Let me ask some clarifying questions to understand better.

PM: Question 1: What events should trigger email notifications?

User: When daemon completes a user story, or when it needs my input

PM: Got it! Question 2: Where should emails be sent?

User: To my work email

PM: Perfect! Question 3: Should emails include links to PRs or just summaries?

User: Full details with PR links

PM: Excellent! Question 4: Any preferences for email frequency (immediate, batched, daily digest)?

User: Immediate for questions, batched for completions

PM: Great! I have all the information I need. Here's the user story draft:

════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
## 📝 US-XXX - Email Notifications for Daemon Events

**User Story**:
> "As a developer I want email notifications when the daemon completes tasks"

**Scope**:
Send email notifications for two event types:
1. Daemon completes user story → Batched notifications
2. Daemon needs user input → Immediate notifications

**Email Content**:
- Event type (completion / question)
- User story details
- PR links (for completions)
- Full context (not just summaries)

**Delivery**:
- Destination: Work email
- Timing: Immediate (questions), Batched (completions)

**Acceptance Criteria**:
1. ✅ Email sent when daemon completes user story (batched)
2. ✅ Email sent when daemon needs input (immediate)
3. ✅ Email includes PR link for completions
4. ✅ Email includes full context, not summary
5. ✅ Email sent to work email address

**Implementation Plan**:
- Phase 1: Email service integration (1 day)
- Phase 2: Event detection (0.5 day)
- Phase 3: Batching logic (0.5 day)
- Phase 4: Templates (0.5 day)

**Estimated Effort**: 2-3 days
**Business Value**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐
════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

Does this match what you had in mind?

Options:
- "yes" / "approve" → I'll add this to ROADMAP.md
- "no" / "changes needed" → Tell me what to adjust
- "cancel" → Discard this user story

User: yes

PM: ✅ Added to ROADMAP.md as US-XXX!
```

## 🚀 RELEASE STRATEGY & VERSIONING

### ✅ What's Deliverable TODAY (Version 0.1.0 - MVP)

**Status**: **🎉 PRODUCTION READY** - All core features are functional and tested

The Coffee Maker Agent is **ALREADY DELIVERABLE** as a functional MVP that provides autonomous development capabilities:

#### Core Features (Working Now)
✅ **Autonomous Development Daemon** (`code_developer`)
- Reads ROADMAP.md and implements priorities autonomously
- Creates branches, commits, and pull requests automatically
- Uses Claude API (Anthropic SDK) or Claude CLI
- Handles complex multi-step implementations
- Self-documents all work with detailed commit messages

✅ **Interactive Chat Interface** (`project-manager`)
- Claude-CLI quality UX with streaming responses
- Multi-line input (Shift+Enter, Alt+Enter)
- Command history with reverse search (Ctrl+R, ↑/↓)
- Auto-completion for commands and priorities (Tab)
- Syntax highlighting (Pygments with monokai theme)
- Session persistence across restarts
- Natural language roadmap editing

✅ **Bidirectional Communication**
- SQLite notifications database (WAL mode for multi-process safety)
- Daemon can ask questions and wait for responses
- project-manager can send commands to daemon
- Real-time notification monitoring with `/notifications` command

✅ **Git Automation**
- Automatic feature branch creation
- Smart commit messages with context
- Pull request creation with descriptions
- Git history tracking for context

✅ **Roadmap Management**
- Structured priority system with decimal notation
- Status tracking (Planned/In Progress/Complete/Blocked)
- User story support (US-XXX)
- Technical specification workflow

#### Current Limitations (MVP Phase)
⚠️ **Manual Process Management**
- `code_developer` and `project_manager` run as separate processes
- User must launch both manually in separate terminals
- No automatic daemon status detection
- No unified launcher (coming in v0.2.0)

⚠️ **Manual File Watching**
- User manually checks ROADMAP.md for daemon updates
- No real-time file change notifications in UI
- Polling-based notification checking (coming in v0.2.0)

#### How to Use Today

**Terminal 1: Start the Daemon**
```bash
cd /Users/bobain/PycharmProjects/MonolithicCoffeeMakerAgent
poetry run code-developer
```

**Terminal 2: Start the Chat Interface**
```bash
cd /Users/bobain/PycharmProjects/MonolithicCoffeeMakerAgent
poetry run project-manager chat
```

**Usage**:
- Talk to project-manager in natural language
- Ask to add features, view priorities, update roadmap
- daemon automatically implements priorities from ROADMAP.md
- daemon sends notifications when it needs input
- Check notifications with `/notifications` command

**Environment Setup**:
Create `.env` file with:
```bash
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your-api-key-here
```

---

### 📦 Version 0.2.0 - Unified Launcher (1 week, 3-5 story points)

**Goal**: Single command to launch entire system with process management

**New Features**:
- `project-manager start --daemon` launches both processes
- `project-manager status` shows daemon status (running/stopped)
- Automatic daemon startup detection and launching
- Process management with psutil
- Graceful shutdown (Ctrl+C stops both processes)
- Integrated logging viewer

**Implementation** (US-009):
- Create `coffee_maker/process_manager.py`
- Add daemon status detection (check PID, process name)
- Add daemon launcher (subprocess with daemon mode)
- Add signal handlers for clean shutdown
- Update `roadmap_cli.py` with `start` and `status` commands

**Dependencies**:
- psutil (already installed)
- daemon PID file (new: `~/.coffee_maker/daemon.pid`)

**User Experience Improvement**:
```bash
# Before (v0.1.0):
Terminal 1: poetry run code-developer
Terminal 2: poetry run project-manager chat

# After (v0.2.0):
poetry run project-manager start --daemon
# Launches both processes, returns to prompt with daemon in background
```

**Estimated Timeline**: 1 week (5 working days)

---

### 🧰 Version 0.3.0 - Developer Tools (2 weeks, 5-8 story points)

**Goal**: IDE integration for code completion from accumulated knowledge

**User Story (US-007)**:
*As a user, I want to have, in my IDE, code completion that comes from code_developer accumulated knowledge on the whole codebase.*

**New Features**:
- LSP (Language Server Protocol) server implementation
- Code completion based on git history analysis
- Project-specific completions from daemon's learned patterns
- Integration with VS Code, PyCharm, Neovim
- Smart suggestions from completed user stories

**Implementation**:
- Create `coffee_maker/lsp_server/`
  - `server.py`: LSP protocol handler
  - `knowledge_extractor.py`: Extract patterns from git history
  - `completion_engine.py`: Generate context-aware completions
  - `config.py`: IDE-specific configuration

**Knowledge Sources**:
1. Git commit history (what patterns daemon learned)
2. User story implementations (how features were built)
3. Code review comments (quality patterns)
4. ROADMAP.md priorities (project context)

**IDE Plugins**:
- VS Code: `coffee-maker-lsp` extension
- PyCharm: Plugin configuration guide
- Neovim: lua config for LSP client

**Example Completion**:
```python
# User types:
def create_notif

# IDE suggests (from US-006 knowledge):
def create_notification(self, type: str, title: str, message: str,
                       priority: str = NOTIF_PRIORITY_NORMAL,
                       context: Optional[Dict] = None) -> int:
    """Create a new notification.

    Based on: US-006 implementation pattern
    See: coffee_maker/cli/notifications.py:45
    """
```

**Estimated Timeline**: 2 weeks (10 working days)

---

### 🤖 Version 1.0.0 - Full Platform (1 month, 8-13 story points)

**Goal**: Autonomous user support assistant handling requests without developer intervention

**User Story (US-008)**:
*As a developer I don't have time to answer user's request like 'please help me complete my code or implement such a feature myself, with the codebase' I need an assistant program that will answer to the user*

**New Features**:
- Multi-channel monitoring (chat, GitHub issues, Discord, Slack)
- Autonomous code help without developer intervention
- Context-aware completions from live codebase
- Intelligent escalation for complex requests
- User session management
- Request prioritization and queuing

**Implementation**:

- Feature implementation guidance
- API documentation
- Example code snippets

**Escalation Rules**:
- Security-sensitive requests → Human developer
- Architecture changes → Human approval
- Payment/billing questions → Human support
- Complex debugging (>30 min) → Human assist

**Example Interaction**:
```
User (GitHub Issue): "How do I add a new priority with a due date?"

Assistant (Auto-response):
"I can help you add a priority with a due date! Here's how:

1. Add this to your ROADMAP.md:
   ```markdown
   ### PRIORITY X: Your Feature 📝 Planned
   **Due Date**: 2025-10-15
   **Goal**: Description of what to build
   ```

2. Or use project-manager chat:
   ```
   Add a new priority "Feature Name" with due date 2025-10-15
   ```

The code_developer daemon will automatically pick it up!

[Based on: ROADMAP.md structure, US-003 implementation]

## ⏸️ DEFERRED: CI Tests (After Chat UX)

**Project**: **code_developer Functional Testing & CI Integration**

**Goal**: Establish comprehensive CI testing to guarantee code_developer remains functional

**Why Deferred**: Chat UX is user-facing and higher priority; daemon already working with manual tests

**Location**: See PRIORITY 2.6 (line 10504+) for complete specification

**Status**: ⏸️ Deferred until US-006 complete

---

## 🎯 Long-Term Vision

**Human-AI Team Collaboration**: In later phases, `code_developer` and `project-manager` will interact with the user just like a very-focused developer, their project manager, and the product's end user would collaborate in a professional team setting:

- 🤖 **code_developer (AI Developer)**: Autonomous coder who implements features, asks clarifying questions, provides progress updates, and demonstrates completed work
- 👔 **project-manager (AI PM)**: Facilitates communication, manages roadmap, prioritizes work, asks for user decisions, and keeps everyone aligned
- 👤 **User (Product Owner)**: Provides requirements, makes decisions, approves features, and gives feedback

**Professional Team Dynamics**:
- Developer asks PM: "Should I use Option A or B for this implementation?"
- PM asks User: "The developer needs approval for dependency X. Approve?"
- Developer shows User: "Feature complete! Here's a demo: [link]"
- User provides feedback: "Great! But can you adjust the color scheme?"
- PM updates roadmap: "Marking Feature Y as ✅ COMPLETED"

This creates a **natural, professional workflow** where AI agents collaborate just like human teams, but with the efficiency and consistency of automation.

---

## 🔄 Meta-Pattern: How We're Working NOW is the Blueprint

**CRITICAL INSIGHT**: The way we (User + Claude) are collaborating RIGHT NOW to build this project **IS THE MODEL** for how `project-manager` and `code-developer` will work together in the future.

### Current Workflow (User + Claude)

**What's happening now**:
```
User: "Add a daily recurring task about checking security vulnerabilities"
  ↓
Claude (as PM): "Got it! I'll add Section 12 with:
  - Daily security monitoring
  - GitHub Dependabot integration
  - Fix workflow by severity
  Should I also add automation scripts?"
  ↓
User: "Yes, and add a refactoring review task too"
  ↓
Claude (as Developer): *Implements both sections in ROADMAP.md*
  ↓
Claude (as PM): "Done! Added Section 12 (Security) and Section 13 (Refactoring).
  Committed and pushed. Here's the summary..."
```

### Future Workflow (project-manager + code-developer)

**What will happen after PRIORITY 3**:
```
User: "Add CSV export feature"
  ↓
project-manager (AI PM): "Got it! Clarifying questions:
  - All fields or specific ones?
  - Button in UI or CLI command?
  - Size limits?"
  ↓
User: "All fields, button in settings, no limit"
  ↓
project-manager: "Perfect! Adding to ROADMAP.md:
  PRIORITY 5: CSV Data Export
  - Export button in settings page
  - All user fields included
  - Pagination for large datasets"
  ↓
project-manager → code-developer: "New task: PRIORITY 5 from ROADMAP.md"
  ↓
code-developer (AI Developer): *Implements the feature autonomously*
  ↓
code-developer → project-manager: "Feature complete! PR #123, all tests passing"
  ↓
project-manager → User: "CSV export is done! Demo: demos/priority_5/demo.py
  Ready to review?"
```

### The Pattern is Identical

| Current (User + Claude) | Future (User + PM + Developer) |
|------------------------|--------------------------------|
| User gives requirements | User gives requirements |
| Claude clarifies as PM | project-manager clarifies |
| Claude implements | code-developer implements |
| Claude reports back | project-manager reports back |
| User reviews and approves | User reviews and approves |

### Why This Matters

**Documentation from Real Experience**:
- Every interaction we have NOW informs the design
- Every clarification question I ask → PM should ask
- Every progress update I give → Developer should give
- Every demo I create → Developer should create

**We're Dogfooding Before Building**:
1. **Now**: User + Claude build the system
2. **Next**: User uses the system we built
3. **Meta**: The system replicates how we built it

**Living Documentation**:
This ROADMAP is being created through the exact workflow that the binaries will automate:
- ✅ User requests feature → I clarify → I implement → I commit → I report
- 🔄 Future: User requests feature → PM clarifies → Developer implements → Developer commits → PM reports

### Examples from This Session

**User Request**: "Add security monitoring task"
- **I acted as PM**: Clarified scope, asked about workflow
- **I acted as Developer**: Implemented Section 12, committed, pushed
- **I acted as PM again**: Provided summary with details

**User Request**: "Add refactoring review task"
- **I acted as PM**: Confirmed understanding
- **I acted as Developer**: Implemented Section 13
- **I acted as PM again**: Summarized what was built

**User Request**: "Add PyPI package & binaries priority"
- **I acted as PM**: Confirmed placement (PRIORITY 3)
- **I acted as Developer**: Created 700+ line specification
- **I acted as PM again**: Explained what was delivered

**User Insight**: "The way we work NOW is the blueprint"
- **I acted as PM**: "Absolutely! Let me document this pattern"
- **I acted as Developer**: *Writing this section right now*
- **I acted as PM again**: Will provide summary after

### Implementation Implications

**For PRIORITY 1 (code-developer)**:
- Must ask clarifying questions (like I do)
- Must report progress (like I do)
- Must create demos (like I do)
- Must provide summaries (like I do)

**For PRIORITY 2 (project-manager)**:
- Must translate user requests to technical specs (like I do)
- Must update ROADMAP.md (like I do)
- Must relay developer questions to user (like I will)
- Must validate completeness before delivery (like I should)

**For PRIORITY 4 (Developer Status Dashboard)**:
- Must show what developer is doing (like I explain my steps)
- Must show progress (like I say "Step 1 of 3")
- Must show blockers (like I say "waiting for your input")

### The Meta-Loop

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ 1. We collaborate (User + Claude) to build the system       │

│    └─> We learn by building, users learn by using           │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Success Metrics

**The binaries are successful if**:
- Users feel like they're working with us RIGHT NOW
- Same level of clarity in questions
- Same level of detail in implementations
- Same level of transparency in progress
- Same level of professionalism in delivery

**The ultimate validation**:
> "Working with project-manager and code-developer feels EXACTLY like
> working with User and Claude to build this roadmap."

## 🚨 Priority Reorganization (2025-10-09)

**What Changed**: Daemon moved from PRIORITY 3 → **PRIORITY 1**

**New Strategy**: Build minimal autonomous daemon FIRST, then let daemon implement remaining priorities autonomously!

**New Priority Order**:
1. 🤖 **Autonomous Development Daemon** (minimal MVP, 3-5 days) - **YOU ARE HERE**
2. 🎯 **Project Manager UI** (single interface for user, 1-2 days) - **HIGH PRIORITY**
   - View roadmap + daemon status in one place
   - See pending notifications (daemon questions)
   - Respond to daemon (approve dependencies, answer questions)
   - Simple terminal UI (TUI with `rich` library)
   - **User's single interface for everything**
3. 📦 **PyPI Package & Binaries** (package for distribution, 1 day) - **CRITICAL TECHNICAL**
   - Configure pyproject.toml with binary entry points
   - Create `project-manager` and `code-developer` CLI commands
   - Package as installable PyPI package (pip install coffee-maker)
   - Test installation and binary execution
   - Publish to PyPI (or TestPyPI first)
   - **User can install and use the binaries system-wide**
4. 📊 **Developer Status Dashboard** (enhance PM UI, 1-2 days) - **HIGH PRIORITY**
   - Display code_developer real-time status (idle, working, blocked, testing)
   - Show current task progress (percentage, elapsed time, ETA)
   - Display developer questions waiting for PM/user response
   - Show recent activity log (commits, tests, errors)
   - Real-time updates via shared status file or database
   - **User always knows what developer is doing**
5. 🗃️ **Database Synchronization** (daemon implements this with PM UI oversight!)
6. 📊 **Analytics & Observability** (daemon implements this!)
7. 📱 **Streamlit Dashboards** (daemon implements this!)
8. 🚀 **Advanced PM Features** (AI chat, Slack integration - daemon implements!)

**Rationale**: Get daemon working ASAP → Daemon autonomously implements everything else → Faster delivery!

**Reference**: `docs/PRIORITY_REORGANIZATION_2025_10_09.md` (detailed rationale and timeline)

## 🔧 Project Binaries (PyPI Package)

When published on PyPI, the `coffee-maker` package will provide **two command-line tools**:

### 1. `project-manager` - User Interface 👤

**Purpose**: Single interface for user to interact with roadmap and daemon

#### Commands (All Phases)

##### Roadmap Management
```bash
# View full roadmap
project-manager view

# View specific priority
project-manager view <priority-number>
project-manager view 3

# View roadmap summary
project-manager view --summary

# Search roadmap
project-manager search <keyword>
project-manager search "analytics"

# Export roadmap
project-manager export --format [markdown|json|html|pdf]
project-manager export --format html --output roadmap.html
```

##### Notification Management
```bash
# List all pending notifications from daemon
project-manager notifications

# List notifications by priority
project-manager notifications --priority [critical|high|normal]

# View specific notification details
project-manager notification <id>

### 2. `code-developer` - Autonomous Daemon 🤖

**Purpose**: Autonomous development daemon that implements roadmap projects (wraps Claude CLI)

#### Commands (All Features)

##### Daemon Lifecycle
```bash
# Start daemon (background mode)
code-developer start

# Start in foreground (debugging mode, see logs)
code-developer start --foreground

# Start with options
code-developer start --auto-approve              # Auto-approve all (dangerous!)
code-developer start --model claude-opus-4       # Use specific model
code-developer start --timeout 7200              # 2 hour timeout
code-developer start --no-pr                     # Don't create PRs
code-developer start --max-iterations 5          # Stop after 5 projects

# Stop daemon (graceful - finish current task)
code-developer stop

# Stop daemon (force kill)
code-developer stop --force

# Stop after current task
code-developer stop --after-task

# Restart daemon
code-developer restart
```

##### Status & Monitoring
```bash
# Check daemon status
code-developer status
# → Shows: running/stopped/paused, current task, uptime, progress

# Live status updates
code-developer status --watch
# → Refreshes every 5 seconds

# Detailed status
code-developer status --verbose
# → Shows: current file, git branch, last commit, tests status

# View daemon logs
code-developer logs
code-developer logs --tail 100              # Last 100 lines
code-developer logs --follow                # Live tail mode
code-developer logs --since "1 hour ago"    # Filter by time
code-developer logs --level [debug|info|warning|error]

# View task history
code-developer history
code-developer history --limit 10           # Last 10 tasks
```

##### Control & Management
```bash
# Pause daemon (finish current task, then wait)
code-developer pause

# Resume paused daemon
code-developer resume

# Skip current task (mark as failed, move to next)
code-developer skip

# Retry failed task
code-developer retry

# Clear task queue
code-developer clear-queue
```

##### Configuration & Setup
```bash
# Initialize daemon (first time setup)
code-developer init
# → Checks Claude CLI installation
# → Verifies gh CLI authentication
# → Creates data directories
# → Sets up logging

# Show current configuration
code-developer config show

# Edit configuration
code-developer config set <key> <value>
code-developer config set timeout 7200
code-developer config set model "claude-sonnet-4"
code-developer config set auto_approve false

# Validate environment
code-developer check
# → Verifies Claude CLI works
# → Checks gh CLI authentication
# → Tests Git repository access
# → Validates ROADMAP.md exists
```

##### Debugging & Troubleshooting
```bash
# Run in debug mode (verbose logging)
code-developer start --debug

# Test daemon without running (dry-run)
code-developer test
# → Parses roadmap
# → Shows what would be executed
# → Validates all prerequisites

# View current task details
code-developer current

# View error details
code-developer errors
code-developer errors --last     # Last error only
```

#### Feature Breakdown

**Core Features** (✅ Implemented - 90%):
- ✅ Autonomous loop (continuously reads roadmap)
- ✅ RoadmapParser (finds next unimplemented project)
- ✅ Claude CLI wrapper (spawns `claude code -p` subprocess)
- ✅ GitManager (creates branches, commits, pushes)
- ✅ Notification system (asks user for approvals)
- ✅ Session conflict detection (won't run inside Claude session)
- ✅ Non-interactive execution (`claude -p` flag)
- ✅ Branch handling (auto-creates feature branches)
- ✅ Basic logging
- ⏳ E2E testing (10% remaining)

**Advanced Features** (📝 Planned):
- [ ] PR creation with `gh` CLI
- [ ] Roadmap status updates (mark complete)
- [ ] Demo creation after completion
- [ ] Test result monitoring
- [ ] Automatic rollback on test failure
- [ ] Smart retry logic with exponential backoff
- [ ] Parallel task execution (multiple projects)
- [ ] Resource monitoring (CPU, memory limits)
- [ ] Cost tracking integration
- [ ] Slack notifications
- [ ] Web dashboard integration

#### Daemon Behavior & Architecture

**Continuous Loop**:
```python
while True:
    # 1. Read ROADMAP.md
    roadmap = RoadmapParser("docs/ROADMAP.md")

    # 2. Find next unimplemented project
    next_project = roadmap.get_next_unimplemented_project()

    if not next_project:
        logger.info("All projects complete! Sleeping...")
        sleep(30)
        continue

    # 3. Ask user for approval (unless --auto-approve)
    if not auto_approve:
        notify_user(f"Ready to implement: {next_project}")
        response = wait_for_user_response()
        if response != "approve":
            continue

    # 4. Create feature branch
    branch = create_branch(f"feature/{next_project.id}")

    # 5. Execute Claude CLI with project spec
    prompt = f"Implement project: {next_project.spec}"
    result = run_claude_cli(prompt, timeout=3600)

    # 6. Verify tests pass
    if not run_tests():
        notify_user("Tests failed! Rolling back...")
        rollback()
        continue

    # 7. Commit and push
    commit_changes(f"feat: Implement {next_project.title}")
    push_branch()

    # 8. Create PR (if enabled)
    if create_prs:
        create_pull_request()

    # 9. Update roadmap status
    update_roadmap_status(next_project, "complete")

    # 10. Create demo
    create_demo(next_project)

    # 11. Notify user
    notify_user(f"✅ {next_project.title} complete!")
```

**Safety Mechanisms**:
1. **Session Detection**: Won't run inside active Claude Code session (conflict check)
2. **File Locks**: Uses file locks to prevent concurrent ROADMAP.md edits
3. **Timeout Protection**: Max execution time per task (default 1 hour)
4. **Test Gating**: Rolls back if tests fail
5. **Permission-First**: Asks before major actions (unless --auto-approve)
6. **Graceful Shutdown**: SIGINT/SIGTERM handler for clean shutdown
7. **Git Safety**: All changes committed to branches, never direct to main
8. **Automatic Rollback**: Failed tasks don't corrupt repository

**Claude CLI Integration**:
```python
class ClaudeCLI:
    def execute(self, prompt: str, timeout: int = 3600):
        """Execute Claude CLI in non-interactive mode."""

        # Use -p flag for non-interactive execution
        cmd = ["claude", "code", "-p", prompt]

        # Set environment
        env = os.environ.copy()
        env["CLAUDE_MODEL"] = self.model

        # Run with timeout
        process = subprocess.Popen(
            cmd,
            stdout=subprocess.PIPE,
            stderr=subprocess.PIPE,
            env=env
        )

        # Wait with timeout
        try:
            stdout, stderr = process.communicate(timeout=timeout)
            return {
                "success": process.returncode == 0,
                "output": stdout.decode(),
                "error": stderr.decode()
            }
        except subprocess.TimeoutExpired:
            process.kill()
            raise TimeoutError(f"Task exceeded {timeout}s")
```

**Key Points**:
- User interacts ONLY with `project-manager`
- `code-developer` runs in background, wrapping Claude CLI
- `code-developer` calls `claude code` subprocess for each task
- All communication through file-based notifications
- User always has control (permission-first!)

---

### 📦 Installation & Setup

```bash
# Install from PyPI
pip install coffee-maker

# Verify binaries available
project-manager --version
claude-coder --version

# First-time setup
project-manager setup
# → Creates data/ directory
# → Initializes ROADMAP.md
# → Configures notification system

# Start daemon
project-manager start-daemon
# or directly:
claude-coder start

# Monitor status
project-manager status
```

---

### 🛡️ Safety Features (Built into MVP)

Both binaries enforce safety from day one:

**`claude-coder` Safety**:
- ✅ Permission-first architecture (ALWAYS asks)
- ✅ File lock on ROADMAP.md (no conflicts)
- ✅ Automatic rollback on test failures
- ✅ Timeout limits (won't run forever)
- ✅ Graceful shutdown (CTRL+C safe)

**`project-manager` Safety**:
- ✅ Input validation (no malformed responses)
- ✅ File lock enforcement (no concurrent edits)
- ✅ Audit log (all user responses logged)
- ✅ Emergency stop (can kill daemon immediately)

**Together**: Permission-first + Single interface = Safe autonomous development

### Phase 1: Self-Implementing System (Current)

Transform **Coffee Maker Agent** into a **self-implementing LLM orchestration framework** with:
- ✅ **Solid infrastructure** (refactoring completed)
- 🔄 **Ongoing cleanup** (codebase simplification in progress by parallel Claude instance)
- 🤖 **Autonomous development** (Claude implements the roadmap itself) ⚡ **NEW PARADIGM**
- 📊 **Advanced analytics** (Langfuse → SQLite/PostgreSQL export)
- 📚 **Professional documentation** (enhanced pdoc)
- 🤖 **Intelligent agents** (5 innovative projects)

**Revolutionary approach**: After implementing Priority 1 (Autonomous Daemon), you only plan features in the roadmap - Claude builds them autonomously!

**Current Status**: Building minimal autonomous daemon to prove the self-implementing concept.

---

### Phase 2: Universal Python Library 🌍 **FUTURE VISION**

**Transform into**: `roadmap-driven-dev` - A Python library that enables **ANY project** to be coded through roadmap-based conversations on top of user's existing code.

**Vision**: What we're building for ourselves becomes a product that helps thousands of developers build software through natural conversation instead of manual coding.

#### The Future Product

```python
# Any developer can use this in their project:
from roadmap_driven_dev import AutonomousDaemon

# Initialize in any Python project
daemon = AutonomousDaemon(
    roadmap_path="docs/ROADMAP.md",
    codebase_root=".",
    model="claude-sonnet-4",
    user_involvement="review_prs"  # or "approve_each_step", "full_autonomy"
)

# Daemon reads YOUR roadmap, understands YOUR codebase, implements YOUR features
daemon.run()

# Developer just:
# 1. Writes roadmap in natural language
# 2. Reviews PRs
# 3. Merges when satisfied
```

#### Key Features (Future)

1. **Language-Agnostic**: Works with any programming language (Python, TypeScript, Rust, Go, etc.)
2. **Codebase-Aware**: Understands existing patterns, follows project conventions
3. **Roadmap-Driven**: Natural language planning → Automatic implementation
4. **Human-in-the-Loop**: Configurable supervision levels (full autonomy ↔ approve each step)
5. **Git-Native**: Branches, commits, PRs follow Git best practices
6. **Test-Driven**: Automatically runs tests, rolls back on failure
7. **Cost-Optimized**: Uses cheaper models for simple tasks, advanced models for complex work
8. **Team-Ready**: Multiple developers + daemon collaborate via PRs

#### Example Use Cases

**Startup Building MVP**:
```markdown
# startup-roadmap.md
PRIORITY 1: User authentication with JWT
PRIORITY 2: PostgreSQL schema for users, products, orders
PRIORITY 3: REST API endpoints (CRUD for all entities)
PRIORITY 4: React frontend with authentication flow
```
→ Daemon implements all 4 priorities in 2 weeks while founders focus on customers

**Open Source Project**:
```markdown
# roadmap.md
PRIORITY 1: Add TypeScript support (currently JavaScript only)
PRIORITY 2: Migrate from Webpack to Vite
PRIORITY 3: Add comprehensive test coverage (currently 30%)
```
→ Daemon implements while maintainer reviews PRs

**Enterprise Migration**:
```markdown
# migration-roadmap.md
PRIORITY 1: Audit all Python 2 code (10,000+ files)
PRIORITY 2: Migrate to Python 3.11 (automated refactoring)
PRIORITY 3: Update all dependencies to latest versions
PRIORITY 4: Add type hints to all public APIs
```
→ Daemon handles tedious migration work

---

### Why This Vision Matters

**Current Problem**: Software development is slow because:
- Writing code is tedious (boilerplate, tests, docs)
- Onboarding new developers takes weeks
- Maintaining legacy code is painful
- Simple features take days instead of hours

**Our Solution**:
```
Natural Language Roadmap → Autonomous Implementation → Human Review → Merge
```

**Impact**:
- 🚀 Ship features 3-5x faster
- 💰 Reduce development costs by 50-70%
- 🧠 Developers focus on architecture, not typing
- 📈 Startups compete with bigger teams
- 🌍 More software gets built, faster

**This is the future of software development. We're building it now.** 🤖

---

### Phase 3+: Human-Like Development Team Interaction 👥 **ADVANCED VISION**

**Vision**: `code-developer` and `project-manager` interact with the user like a real, highly-focused development team would:

```
User (Product Owner)  ←→  project-manager (PM)  ←→  code-developer (Developer)
```

#### Three-Role Interaction Model

**User's Role** (Product Owner/End User):
- Defines features in natural language
- Reviews results and gives feedback
- Makes business decisions
- Tests features as end user

**`project-manager`'s Role** (Project Manager):
- Clarifies requirements with user
- Breaks down features into technical tasks
- Prioritizes work (critical bugs before new features)
- Reports progress and blockers
- Shields developer from constant interruptions
- Validates deliverables before showing to user

**`code-developer`'s Role** (Focused Developer):
- Implements features autonomously
- Asks PM technical questions (not the user directly)
- Reports completion to PM (not the user)
- Focuses on code quality and tests
- Works in deep focus without context switching

#### Example Conversation Flow

**1. Feature Request** (User → PM):
```
User: "I want users to be able to export their data to CSV"

project-manager: "Got it! Let me clarify a few things:
  - What data should be exported? (All fields or specific ones?)
  - Should this be a button in the UI or a CLI command?
  - Any size limits? (Some exports could be huge)
  - Format: headers, date format, encoding?"

User: "All user data, button in settings page, no size limit (pagination if needed), standard CSV with headers"

project-manager: "Perfect! I'll add this to the roadmap:

PRIORITY 5: CSV Data Export
- Add export button to settings page
- Include all user fields (name, email, created_at, etc.)
- Paginate for large datasets (>10k rows)
- Standard CSV: UTF-8, headers, ISO date format

I'll assign this to code-developer. ETA: 4-6 hours.
I'll notify you when it's ready for testing."
```

**2. Implementation** (PM → Developer):
```
project-manager → code-developer:
"New task from user: PRIORITY 5 - CSV Data Export
See ROADMAP.md for details.
User wants this in settings page with pagination.
Let me know if you have questions."

code-developer:
"Acknowledged. Starting implementation.
Question: Should CSV download trigger immediately or generate in background?"

project-manager:
"Good question. Let me check with user..."
→ [asks user, gets answer]
→ "User says immediate download is fine (<1s is acceptable)"

code-developer:
"Got it. Implementing now..."
→ [2 hours later]
→ "Feature complete. All tests passing.
   Created PR #123. Ready for PM review."
```

**3. Review & Delivery** (PM → User):
```
project-manager: "CSV export feature is complete! 🎉

Demo: demos/priority_5_csv_export/demo.py
PR: #123 (all tests passing ✅)

New Features:
  ✅ Export button in settings page
  ✅ All user data included
  ✅ Handles large datasets (tested with 50k rows)
  ✅ Standard CSV format

Please test and let me know if any changes needed."

User: "Looks great! But can we add a timestamp to the filename?"

project-manager → code-developer:
"User feedback: Add timestamp to CSV filename
Example: user_export_2025_10_09_14_30.csv"

code-developer:
"Done. Updated PR #123."

project-manager → User:
"Updated! Filename now includes timestamp. Ready to merge?"

User: "Perfect, merge it!"

project-manager: "Merged ✅. Feature is now live."
```

#### Advanced Interactions (Future)

**Developer Asking for Design Decisions**:
```
code-developer → project-manager:
"Implementing user authentication. Which approach:
  A) JWT tokens (stateless, scales well)
  B) Sessions (stateful, simpler, more secure)

Current codebase has no auth, so we can choose."

project-manager → User:
"code-developer needs decision on authentication:
  - JWT: Better for mobile apps, microservices
  - Sessions: Better for web-only, simpler

Which fits your use case better?"

User: "We're web-only, keep it simple"

project-manager → code-developer:
"User chose sessions (web-only, prioritize simplicity)"

code-developer: "Acknowledged. Implementing session-based auth."
```

**PM Shielding Developer from Noise**:
```
User: "Hey, can you add dark mode?"
User: "Also, the logo should be bigger"
User: "And can we have user profiles?"
User: "Oh, and email notifications would be nice"

project-manager:
"Got all your requests! Let me organize them:

CURRENT (In Progress):
  - PRIORITY 5: CSV Export (code-developer working on it)

BACKLOG (After current task):
  - PRIORITY 6: Dark mode
  - PRIORITY 7: User profiles
  - PRIORITY 8: Email notifications
  - PRIORITY 9: Bigger logo (quick win)

I'll batch these so code-developer can focus without context switching.
Sound good?"

User: "Yes, perfect!"

→ PM only interrupts developer for critical bugs, not every feature request
```

**PM Prioritizing Critical Bugs**:
```
User: "URGENT: Users can't login!"

project-manager → code-developer:
"🚨 CRITICAL BUG: Login broken
Pausing current work (PRIORITY 5).
Investigate immediately."

code-developer:
"Checking... Found issue: session timeout too short.
Fixed and deployed. Testing now."
→ [10 minutes later]
→ "Login working. Tests passing. Resumed PRIORITY 5."

project-manager → User:
"✅ Login fixed! Root cause: session timeout.
Increased to 24h. All users can login now.
code-developer back to CSV export feature."
```

#### Benefits of This Model

**For User**:
- Single point of contact (`project-manager`)
- Don't need to know technical details
- Can focus on business requirements
- Get progress updates without asking
- Feel like managing a real team

**For Project Manager**:
- Understand user's business needs
- Translate to technical requirements
- Prioritize work effectively
- Manage multiple tasks in backlog
- Shield developer from constant interruptions

**For Code Developer**:
- Deep focus without context switching
- Clear, technical requirements (not vague requests)
- Ask PM questions, not interrupt user
- Work autonomously on implementation
- Deliver to PM, not directly to user

#### Implementation Phases

**Phase 3A** (Month 3-4): PM-Developer Separation
- `project-manager` maintains ROADMAP.md
- `code-developer` reads ROADMAP.md, implements tasks
- PM reviews PRs before showing to user
- Communication via shared notification system

**Phase 3B** (Month 5-6): Natural Language Understanding
- PM understands vague requests ("make it faster", "improve UX")
- PM asks clarifying questions like a human PM
- Developer asks technical questions to PM
- PM translates between business and technical language

**Phase 3C** (Month 7-8): Context-Aware Collaboration
- PM knows when to interrupt developer (critical bugs)
- PM batches small requests to avoid context switching
- Developer proactively asks for design decisions
- PM tracks developer's focus time and productivity

**Phase 3D** (Month 9-12): Team Dynamics
- PM negotiates timelines ("User wants feature tomorrow" → "Realistically 3 days")
- Developer pushes back on unclear requirements
- PM advocates for technical debt paydown
- Team learns user's communication style and adapts

#### Success Criteria

- User feels like they have a **real development team**
- User never needs to think about "Claude CLI" or "technical implementation"
- PM handles all complexity, user just describes what they want
- Developer stays in deep focus 80%+ of the time
- Features get delivered 3-5x faster than human teams
- User trust increases (team is reliable, professional, predictable)

**This creates the illusion of a small, highly-efficient software team - but it's just two AI agents collaborating.** 👥🤖

**Current Status**: Phase 1 (Self-Implementing System) - Building the foundation by having the system implement itself first.

---

## 📦 PRIORITY 3: PyPI Package & Binaries

**Goal**: Package coffee-maker as installable PyPI package with `project-manager` and `code-developer` command-line tools

**Duration**: 1 day (4-8 hours)
**Dependencies**: PRIORITY 1 (Daemon core), PRIORITY 2 (PM CLI core)
**Status**: 📝 Planned

### Why This Is Critical

After implementing PRIORITY 1 & 2, we have:
- ✅ Daemon core logic (code-developer functionality)
- ✅ Project Manager CLI logic (project-manager functionality)

**But users can't install and use them yet!**
- ❌ No `pip install coffee-maker` command
- ❌ No system-wide `project-manager` binary
- ❌ No system-wide `code-developer` binary
- ❌ Can't distribute to others

**This priority makes the binaries installable and distributable!**

### ⚡ Quick-Start Option Available Now

**While waiting for PRIORITY 3**, you can run the daemon using the temporary convenience script:

⚠️  **CRITICAL REQUIREMENT**: The daemon MUST run from a **separate terminal**, NOT from within Claude Code!

**Why?** The daemon spawns Claude CLI sessions to implement features. Running it from within an existing Claude Code session creates a nested/recursive conflict that causes it to hang indefinitely.

**Correct Usage:**

1. **Exit Claude Code** (if currently in a session)
2. **Open a NEW terminal** (completely separate)
3. **Navigate to project and activate environment:**
   ```bash
   cd /Users/bobain/PycharmProjects/MonolithicCoffeeMakerAgent
   source /Users/bobain/Library/Caches/pypoetry/virtualenvs/coffee-maker-efk4LJvC-py3.11/bin/activate
   ```
4. **Run the daemon:**
   ```bash
   # Interactive mode (asks for approval)
   python run_daemon.py

   # Autonomous mode (auto-approve)
   python run_daemon.py --auto-approve

   # See all options
   python run_daemon.py --help
   ```

The script includes runtime detection and will warn you if it detects a Claude session.

### Release Command Implementation

**Command**: `project-manager release <version> [--test] [--dry-run]`

**Purpose**: Automate the release process from version bump to PyPI publication

**Workflow**:
```
1. Update version → 2. Run tests → 3. Build → 4. Git tag → 5. Publish → 6. Push
```

**Implementation**:
```python
# File: coffee_maker/cli/project_manager.py

import subprocess
import tomli
import tomli_w
from pathlib import Path


def update_version_in_pyproject(version: str):
    """Update version in pyproject.toml."""
    pyproject_path = Path("pyproject.toml")

    with open(pyproject_path, "rb") as f:
        data = tomli.load(f)

    data["project"]["version"] = version

    with open(pyproject_path, "wb") as f:
        tomli_w.dump(data, f)

    console.print(f"[green]✅ Updated version to {version}[/]")


def run_tests():
    """Run test suite before release."""
    result = subprocess.run(["pytest", "tests/", "-v"], capture_output=True)

    if result.returncode != 0:
        console.print("[red]❌ Tests failed! Aborting release.[/]")
        raise click.Abort()

    console.print("[green]✅ All tests passed[/]")


def build_package():
    """Build wheel and sdist."""
    subprocess.run(["python", "-m", "build"], check=True)
    console.print("[green]✅ Package built successfully[/]")


def create_git_tag(version: str):
    """Create and push git tag."""
    subprocess.run(["git", "add", "pyproject.toml"], check=True)
    subprocess.run(["git", "commit", "-m", f"Release v{version}"], check=True)
    subprocess.run(["git", "tag", f"v{version}"], check=True)
    console.print(f"[green]✅ Created git tag v{version}[/]")


def publish_to_pypi(test: bool = False):
    """Publish to PyPI or TestPyPI."""
    if test:
        subprocess.run(
            ["twine", "upload", "--repository", "testpypi", "dist/*"],
            check=True
        )
        console.print("[green]✅ Published to TestPyPI[/]")
    else:
        subprocess.run(["twine", "upload", "dist/*"], check=True)
        console.print("[green]✅ Published to PyPI[/]")


def push_to_github():
    """Push commits and tags to GitHub."""
    subprocess.run(["git", "push"], check=True)
    subprocess.run(["git", "push", "--tags"], check=True)
    console.print("[green]✅ Pushed to GitHub[/]")


@main.command()
@click.argument("version")
@click.option("--test", is_flag=True, help="Publish to TestPyPI")
@click.option("--dry-run", is_flag=True, help="Build without publishing")
def release(version: str, test: bool, dry_run: bool):
    """Release the project to PyPI."""
    try:
        # 1. Update version
        update_version_in_pyproject(version)

        # 2. Run tests
        run_tests()

        # 3. Build package
        build_package()

        # 4. Git tag
        create_git_tag(version)

        if dry_run:
            console.print("[yellow]Dry run - stopping before publish[/]")
            return

        # 5. Publish
        publish_to_pypi(test=test)

        # 6. Push to GitHub
        push_to_github()

        console.print(f"[bold green]✅ Released v{version} successfully![/]")

        if test:
            console.print("\n[cyan]Install from TestPyPI:[/]")
            console.print(f"pip install --index-url https://test.pypi.org/simple/ coffee-maker=={version}")
        else:
            console.print("\n[cyan]Users can now install:[/]")
            console.print(f"pip install coffee-maker=={version}")

    except Exception as e:
        console.print(f"[red]❌ Release failed: {e}[/]")
        raise click.Abort()
```

**Usage Examples**:
```bash
# Dry run (build but don't publish)
project-manager release 0.1.0 --dry-run

# Publish to TestPyPI (test first)
project-manager release 0.1.0 --test

# Publish to production PyPI
project-manager release 0.1.0

# Publish new version
project-manager release 0.2.0
```

**Checklist Before Release**:
- [ ] All tests passing (`pytest tests/`)
- [ ] All code formatted (`black coffee_maker/`)
- [ ] All linting passed (`ruff check coffee_maker/`)
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] CHANGELOG.md updated with changes
- [ ] Version number follows semver (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH)

**Release Steps Automated**:
1. ✅ Update version in pyproject.toml
2. ✅ Run full test suite (blocks if tests fail)
3. ✅ Build wheel and sdist packages
4. ✅ Create git commit and tag (v{version})
5. ✅ Upload to PyPI/TestPyPI via twine
6. ✅ Push commit and tags to GitHub

**Safety Features**:
- Tests must pass or release aborts
- Git tag prevents re-releasing same version
- --dry-run option to test without publishing
- --test option to publish to TestPyPI first
- Clear error messages if any step fails

## 📊 PRIORITY 4: Developer Status Dashboard

**Goal**: Enhance `project-manager` to display real-time `code-developer` status, progress, and questions

**Duration**: 1-2 days (6-12 hours)
**Dependencies**: PRIORITY 1 (Daemon), PRIORITY 2 (PM CLI), PRIORITY 3 (Package & Binaries)
**Status**: 📝 Planned

### Why This Is Critical

After implementing PRIORITY 1 (Daemon) and PRIORITY 2 (PM UI), the user has:
- ✅ Autonomous developer working 24/7
- ✅ Simple CLI to view roadmap and notifications

**But the user doesn't know**:
- ❓ What is the developer doing RIGHT NOW?
- ❓ Is it stuck? Is it making progress?
- ❓ How long until current task is done?
- ❓ Are there questions waiting for me?

**This priority solves visibility gap**: User always knows developer status without asking!

---

### Core Features

#### 1. Real-Time Developer Status Display

**Command**: `project-manager developer-status`

**Output**:
```

```

#### 2. Developer States

**Possible States**:
- 🟢 **WORKING**: Actively implementing current task
- 🟡 **TESTING**: Running tests, waiting for results
- 🔴 **BLOCKED**: Waiting for user response (dependency approval, design decision)
- ⚪ **IDLE**: Between tasks, reading roadmap
- 🔵 **THINKING**: Analyzing codebase, planning implementation
- 🟣 **REVIEWING**: Creating PR, writing documentation
- ⚫ **STOPPED**: Daemon not running

**State Transitions**:
```
IDLE → THINKING → WORKING → TESTING → REVIEWING → IDLE
                    ↓
                 BLOCKED (if needs user input)
                    ↓
                 WORKING (after user responds)
```

#### 3. Progress Tracking

**Progress Indicators**:
```python
# Developer reports progress at key milestones
progress_milestones = {
    0: "Starting task",
    10: "Read requirements",
    20: "Analyzed codebase",
    30: "Designed solution",
    40: "Implementing core logic",
    50: "Half done",
    60: "Core functionality complete",
    70: "Adding tests",
    80: "Tests passing",
    90: "Creating documentation",
    95: "Creating PR",
    100: "Task complete"
}
```

**ETA Calculation**:
```python
# Based on historical task completion times
avg_time_per_priority = {
    "PRIORITY 1": 8 hours,
    "PRIORITY 2": 6 hours,
    "PRIORITY 3": 4 hours
}

# Adjusts dynamically based on actual progress
elapsed_time = now - started_at
progress_rate = current_progress / elapsed_time
estimated_remaining = (100 - current_progress) / progress_rate
```

#### 4. Activity Log

**Tracked Activities**:
- File modifications (which files, how many lines changed)
- Git operations (commits, branch creation, pushes)
- Test runs (passed, failed, skipped)
- Questions asked (to PM or user)
- Dependency requests
- Errors encountered

**Log Format**:
```json
{
  "timestamp": "2025-10-09T11:30:00Z",
  "activity_type": "git_commit",
  "description": "Committed status display logic",
  "details": {
    "files_modified": 3,
    "lines_added": 145,
    "lines_deleted": 12,
    "commit_hash": "abc1234"
  }
}
```

#### 5. Questions Dashboard

**Display Pending Questions**:
```
❓ QUESTIONS WAITING FOR RESPONSE
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

[Q1] Dependency Approval - WAITING 15 minutes
  Package: pandas>=2.0.0
  Reason: Required for CSV export with advanced filtering

  }
}
```

#### Integration with code-developer

**Developer reports status**:
```python
# In code-developer daemon
class DeveloperStatus:
    def __init__(self):
        self.status_file = Path("data/developer_status.json")

    def update_status(self, status: str, task: Dict, progress: int):
        """Update status file with current state."""
        status_data = {
            "status": status,
            "current_task": task,
            "progress": progress,
            "last_activity": {
                "timestamp": datetime.utcnow().isoformat() + "Z",
                "type": "status_update"
            }
        }

        with open(self.status_file, 'w') as f:
            json.dump(status_data, f, indent=2)

    def report_activity(self, activity_type: str, description: str):
        """Add activity to log."""
        # Read current status
        status = self._load_status()

        # Add activity
        activity = {
            "timestamp": datetime.utcnow().isoformat() + "Z",
            "type": activity_type,
            "description": description
        }
        status["activity_log"].append(activity)

        # Keep only last 50 activities
        status["activity_log"] = status["activity_log"][-50:]

        # Save
        self._save_status(status)

    def report_progress(self, progress: int, current_step: str):
        """Update progress percentage."""
        status = self._load_status()
        status["current_task"]["progress"] = progress
        status["current_step"] = current_step

        # Calculate ETA
        elapsed = datetime.utcnow() - datetime.fromisoformat(
            status["current_task"]["started_at"].replace("Z", "")
        )
        if progress > 0:
            total_estimated = elapsed.total_seconds() * (100 / progress)
            remaining = total_estimated - elapsed.total_seconds()
            status["current_task"]["eta_seconds"] = int(remaining)

        self._save_status(status)
```

#### Integration with project-manager

**PM CLI displays status**:
```python
# In project-manager CLI
class DeveloperStatusDisplay:
    def show_status(self):
        """Display developer status in terminal."""
        from rich.console import Console
        from rich.panel import Panel
        from rich.progress import Progress

        console = Console()
        status = self._load_status()

        # Status indicator with emoji
        status_emoji = {
            "working": "🟢",
            "testing": "🟡",
            "blocked": "🔴",
            "idle": "⚪",
            "thinking": "🔵"
        }

        # Progress bar
        progress = status["current_task"]["progress"]

        # Format output
        console.print(Panel(
            f"{status_emoji[status['status']]} {status['status'].upper()}\n"
            f"Task: {status['current_task']['name']}\n"
            f"Progress: {progress}%\n"
            f"ETA: {self._format_eta(status['current_task']['eta_seconds'])}",
            title="🤖 CODE DEVELOPER STATUS"
        ))
```

---

### Implementation Steps

**Day 1** (4-6 hours):
1. Create `data/developer_status.json` schema
2. Add status reporting to `code-developer` daemon:
   - `update_status()` method
   - `report_activity()` method
   - `report_progress()` method
3. Add status display to `project-manager`:
   - `developer-status` command
   - Rich terminal formatting
   - Real-time refresh option

**Day 2** (2-4 hours):
4. Add activity log tracking (last 50 activities)
5. Add questions dashboard integration
6. Add metrics tracking (commits, tests, etc.)
7. Test full workflow:
   - Start daemon → Check status → See progress
   - Developer asks question → Shows in PM
   - Respond → Developer unblocks

---

### Success Criteria

✅ **User can always see developer status**:
- Run `project-manager developer-status` → See current state
- Know if developer is working, blocked, or idle

✅ **User knows progress**:
- See percentage complete (0-100%)
- See ETA (estimated time remaining)
- See recent activities (last 30 min)

✅ **User sees questions immediately**:
- Questions show up in status view
- Clear call-to-action (respond command)
- Developer unblocks after response

✅ **Updates are real-time**:
- Status file updates every minute (or on state change)
- PM CLI shows fresh data
- Optional: `--watch` mode for continuous updates

---

### Future Enhancements (Post-PRIORITY 3)

- **Web UI**: Browser-based status dashboard (instead of terminal)
- **Push Notifications**: Desktop/mobile alerts when developer asks questions
- **Historical Tracking**: Graph of progress over time
- **Multi-Developer**: Track multiple developers working in parallel
- **Slack Integration**: Developer status posts to Slack channel

---

**This gives the user complete visibility into what the autonomous developer is doing, removing the "black box" feeling and building trust!** 📊🤖

---

## 🔄 Recurring Best Practices

**Philosophy**: Every new feature implementation is an opportunity to improve the entire codebase. These practices should be applied **continuously** throughout development, not as separate tasks.

### 1. 🗃️ Database Synchronization Review ⚡ **CRITICAL**

**When**: Before implementing ANY feature that touches the database
**Why**: Daemon runs in isolated Docker environment - data must be accessible to both daemon and user

**Checklist**:
- [ ] Does this feature write to database? → Verify write goes to shared database path
- [ ] Does this feature read from database? → Verify read comes from shared database path
- [ ] Will daemon need this data? → Ensure it's in shared `/project/data/` directory
- [ ] Will user's tools need this data? → Ensure notifications/analytics are synced
- [ ] Are there concurrent writes? → Apply `@with_retry` decorator + WAL mode
- [ ] New database table? → Update Data Ownership Matrix in PRIORITY 1.5 design doc

**Common Pitfall**: Creating database in daemon's isolated `/daemon-env/data/` instead of shared `/project/data/`

**Reference**: `docs/PRIORITY_1.5_DATABASE_SYNC_DESIGN.md`

---

### 2. 🧹 Code Refactoring & Simplification

**When**: After implementing any feature, before marking it complete
**Why**: Technical debt accumulates quickly - clean as you build

**Sprint 1 Example** (Real work done):
- ✅ 800+ lines removed (deprecated code)
- ✅ 27 lines duplication eliminated (time threshold calculations)
- ✅ Manual retry loops → `@with_retry` decorator (11 methods)
- ✅ Missing observability → `@observe` decorator (11 methods)

**Refactoring Opportunities to Look For**:

**A. Manual Retry Loops → Centralized Utilities**
```python
# BEFORE (18 lines, repeated 3x):
attempt = 0
while attempt < 3:
    try:
        return self.invoke(**kwargs)
    except RateLimitError as e:
        print("Rate limit reached...")
        time.sleep(2**attempt)
        attempt += 1

# AFTER (cleaner, observable):
@with_retry(
    max_attempts=3,
    backoff_base=2.0,
    retriable_exceptions=(RateLimitError,),
)
def _invoke_with_retry():
    return self.invoke(**kwargs)
```

**B. Duplicate Calculations → Reusable Utilities**
```python
# BEFORE (9 lines, repeated 3x = 27 lines):
now = time.time()
if timeframe == "day":
    threshold = now - 86400
elif timeframe == "hour":
    threshold = now - 3600
# ... etc

# AFTER (1 line):
threshold = get_timestamp_threshold(timeframe)
```

**C. Missing Observability → Add `@observe` Decorator**
```python
# Add to all database queries, analytics methods, cost tracking
@observe
@with_retry(
    max_attempts=3,
    retriable_exceptions=(OperationalError, TimeoutError),
)
def get_llm_performance(self, days: int = 7) -> Dict:
    """Get LLM performance metrics."""
    # ... existing logic
```

**Checklist**:
- [ ] Search for repeated code patterns (copy-paste duplication)
- [ ] Identify manual retry/backoff logic → replace with `@with_retry`
- [ ] Find missing `@observe` decorators on critical methods
- [ ] Look for hard-coded magic numbers → extract to constants
- [ ] Check for orphaned/commented-out code → delete it
- [ ] Verify type hints on all public functions
- [ ] Run `ruff check` and `mypy` - fix all issues

**Reference**: `docs/sprint1_improvements_summary.md`

---

### 3. 📝 Documentation Updating

**When**: Immediately after changing any public API or adding features
**Why**: Stale documentation is worse than no documentation

**What to Update**:
- [ ] **Docstrings**: Update function/class docstrings with new parameters
- [ ] **ROADMAP.md**: Mark features complete, update status
- [ ] **README.md**: Add new CLI commands, update examples
- [ ] **Type hints**: Add/update return types and parameter types
- [ ] **Architecture docs**: Update diagrams if structure changed
- [ ] **Migration guides**: Document breaking changes

**Example**:
```python
# Update docstrings with type hints
def calculate_cost(
    self,
    timeframe: Literal["minute", "hour", "day", "all"] = "all",
    model: Optional[str] = None,
) -> Dict[str, float]:
    """Calculate LLM usage cost for a timeframe.

    Args:
        timeframe: Time window for cost calculation
        model: Optional model filter

    Returns:
        Dictionary with total_cost, input_cost, output_cost

    Example:
        >>> calc.calculate_cost(timeframe="day", model="gpt-4")
        {'total_cost': 5.23, 'input_cost': 2.10, 'output_cost': 3.13}
    """
```

**Tools**:
- Run `pdoc` to regenerate API docs: `python scripts/generate_docs.py`
- Check for TODO/FIXME comments: `grep -r "TODO\|FIXME" coffee_maker/`

---

### 4. 🧪 Test Coverage Maintenance

**When**: Before committing any changes
**Why**: Tests are living documentation and prevent regressions

**Checklist**:
- [ ] New feature → Add unit tests
- [ ] Bug fix → Add regression test
- [ ] Refactoring → Ensure existing tests still pass
- [ ] Database changes → Add integration tests
- [ ] API changes → Update API tests

**Test Philosophy**:
```python
# Test BEHAVIOR, not implementation
# GOOD:
def test_retry_exhaustion_returns_none():
    """When retries exhausted, should return None."""

# BAD:
def test_retry_calls_sleep_three_times():
    """Should call time.sleep() exactly 3 times."""
```

**Sprint 1 Results**: 112 tests passing (retry + time + analytics)

**Commands**:
```bash
# Run all tests
pytest tests/ -v

# Run with coverage
pytest tests/ --cov=coffee_maker --cov-report=html

# Run specific test file
pytest tests/unit/test_analytics.py -v
```

---

### 5. 🎨 Code Formatting & Linting

**When**: Before every commit (automated via pre-commit hooks)
**Why**: Consistent style improves readability and reduces diff noise

**Tools** (already configured):
- **black**: Code formatting
- **ruff**: Fast linting
- **mypy**: Type checking
- **isort**: Import sorting

**Commands**:
```bash
# Format all code
black coffee_maker/ tests/

# Lint and auto-fix
ruff check coffee_maker/ tests/ --fix

# Type check
mypy coffee_maker/

# Run all pre-commit hooks
pre-commit run --all-files
```

**Pre-commit Integration**: Hooks run automatically on `git commit`

---

### 6. 🔍 Performance Profiling

**When**: After implementing compute-intensive features
**Why**: LLM operations are expensive - optimize early

**What to Profile**:
- [ ] Database queries (use `EXPLAIN QUERY PLAN`)
- [ ] LLM token usage (via Langfuse analytics)
- [ ] Retry/timeout settings (too aggressive?)
- [ ] Connection pool size (too small/large?)

**Example**:
```python
# Profile database query performance
import time
start = time.time()
results = conn.execute("SELECT * FROM traces WHERE ...").fetchall()
print(f"Query took {time.time() - start:.2f}s")

# Use Langfuse to track LLM costs
@observe(capture_input=False, capture_output=False)
def expensive_llm_call():
    # Langfuse automatically tracks tokens, cost, latency
    pass
```

**Tools**:
- Langfuse dashboard for LLM metrics
- `cProfile` for Python profiling
- SQLite `EXPLAIN QUERY PLAN` for queries

---

### 7. 🔐 Security Review

**When**: Before releasing features that touch external APIs or user data
**Why**: LLM systems handle sensitive data - security first

**Checklist**:
- [ ] API keys stored in environment variables (not code)
- [ ] Database paths don't leak sensitive info
- [ ] User inputs sanitized before database queries
- [ ] Error messages don't expose internal details
- [ ] Logs don't contain API keys or secrets

**Example**:
```python
# GOOD:
api_key = os.environ.get("OPENAI_API_KEY")
logger.info("API request completed")

# BAD:
api_key = "sk-..."  # Hard-coded
logger.info(f"API request with key {api_key}")
```

---

### 8. 📊 Analytics & Observability

**When**: For all critical operations (LLM calls, database queries, external APIs)
**Why**: Can't optimize what you can't measure

**Add Observability**:
```python
# LLM operations
@observe
def call_llm(prompt: str) -> str:
    # Langfuse tracks: tokens, cost, latency, model
    pass

# Database operations
@observe
@with_retry(retriable_exceptions=(OperationalError,))
def get_traces(days: int) -> List[Dict]:
    # Track query performance and retries
    pass

# Critical business logic
@observe(capture_input=True, capture_output=True)
def process_roadmap_update(changes: Dict) -> bool:
    # Track input/output for debugging
    pass
```

**Sprint 1 Results**: 11 critical methods now observable in Langfuse

---

### 9. 🗂️ Dependency Management

**When**: Monthly review or when adding new dependencies
**Why**: Outdated dependencies have security vulnerabilities

**Commands**:
```bash
# Check for outdated packages
pip list --outdated

# Update specific package
pip install --upgrade langchain

# Update all packages (carefully!)
pip install --upgrade -r requirements.txt

# Security audit
pip-audit
```

**Best Practices**:
- Pin major versions: `langchain>=0.1.0,<0.2.0`
- Use `requirements-dev.txt` for dev dependencies
- Keep virtual environment clean

#### 🤖 DAEMON REQUIREMENT: New Dependency Approval ⚡ **CRITICAL**

**Rule**: The autonomous daemon **MUST ask for user permission** before adding any new dependency.

**Why This Is Critical**:

1. **Security** 🔐 - Dependencies can contain malicious code (supply chain attacks)
2. **License Compliance** ⚖️ - GPL in proprietary code = legal violation
3. **Cost Management** 💰 - Some dependencies have API usage costs
4. **Codebase Bloat** 📦 - `pandas` (200MB) when `csv` suffices
5. **Maintenance Burden** 🔧 - More dependencies = more updates, more breaking changes
6. **Version Conflicts** ⚠️ - New dependency may conflict with existing ones

**Implementation Pattern**:
```python
def request_dependency_approval(self, package: str, reason: str) -> bool:
    """Request user approval before installing dependency."""
    notification = f"""
🤖 DAEMON REQUEST: New Dependency Approval

Package: {package}
Reason: {reason}

Please review:
- Check package on PyPI (security, license, maintainers)
- Verify license compatibility
- Approve: /approve-dependency {package}
- Reject: /reject-dependency {package}
"""
    self.send_notification(notification)
    return self.wait_for_user_response(timeout=3600)  # 1 hour
```

**Example**:
```
🤖 DAEMON: May I install 'psycopg2-binary>=2.9.9'?
Reason: Required for PostgreSQL connection (PRIORITY 2)
License: LGPL-3.0
Size: ~5MB

👤 USER: /reject-dependency psycopg2-binary
Reason: We're using SQLite MVP, not PostgreSQL yet.

🤖 DAEMON: Acknowledged. Using sqlite3 (standard library).
```

**Pre-Approved Dependencies** (no permission needed):
- Standard library modules (no install)
- Already in `requirements.txt`
- Testing/linting (dev dependencies)

**This protects users from**:
- ✅ Malicious packages
- ✅ License violations
- ✅ Unexpected costs
- ✅ Bloat/conflicts
- ✅ Maintenance burden

**Non-negotiable for autonomous systems.** 🔐

---

### 10. 🎯 Roadmap Synchronization

**When**: After completing any feature or making architectural decisions
**Why**: ROADMAP.md is the source of truth for the autonomous daemon

**What to Update**:
- [ ] Mark completed priorities with ✅
- [ ] Update timelines based on actual effort
- [ ] Add new priorities discovered during implementation
- [ ] Update dependency chains (PRIORITY X → PRIORITY Y)
- [ ] Document architectural decisions (ADRs)
- [ ] Update estimates based on learnings

**Tool**: Use `coffee-roadmap` CLI (PRIORITY 2) for all roadmap updates

---

### 11. 🔄 GitHub CI/CD Monitoring (Daily Task)

**When**: Daily, after pushing to GitHub
**Why**: Catch CI failures early before they block development

**Daily Checklist**:
- [ ] Check if branch is pushed to remote (`git status`, `git branch -r`)
- [ ] Verify GitHub Actions are passing
- [ ] Review any failing tests or linting errors
- [ ] Fix issues immediately (don't let them accumulate)
- [ ] Ensure PR status checks are green before merging

**Commands**:
```bash
# Check remote branch status
git status
git branch -r | grep feature/your-branch

# Push if not synced
git push origin feature/your-branch

# Check GitHub Actions via CLI (requires gh CLI)
gh run list --branch feature/your-branch --limit 5

# View specific workflow run
gh run view <run-id>

# View logs for failed run
gh run view <run-id> --log-failed
```

**GitHub Actions to Monitor**:
- ✅ **Tests**: All pytest tests passing
- ✅ **Linting**: black, ruff, mypy checks
- ✅ **Type Checking**: mypy strict mode
- ✅ **Security**: pip-audit for vulnerabilities
- ✅ **Build**: Package builds successfully

**If CI Fails**:

1. **Read the error logs**:
   ```bash
   gh run view <run-id> --log-failed
   ```

2. **Reproduce locally**:
   ```bash
   # Run the same checks that GitHub Actions runs
   pytest tests/ -v
   black --check coffee_maker/ tests/
   ruff check coffee_maker/ tests/
   mypy coffee_maker/
   ```

3. **Fix the issue**:
   - Fix failing tests
   - Fix linting/formatting errors
   - Fix type errors
   - Update dependencies if needed

4. **Push the fix**:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "fix: Resolve CI failures - <brief description>"
   git push
   ```

5. **Verify fix**:
   ```bash
   gh run list --branch feature/your-branch --limit 1
   ```

**Automation Tips**:
```bash
# Add alias to check CI status
alias ci-status='gh run list --branch $(git branch --show-current) --limit 5'

# Check CI in watch mode (updates every 10s)
watch -n 10 'gh run list --branch $(git branch --show-current) --limit 1'
```

**🤖 DAEMON REQUIREMENT**:
The autonomous daemon **MUST** check CI status after every push and fix any failures before moving to next task. If CI fails:
1. Read error logs
2. Fix the issue
3. Push fix
4. Wait for CI to pass
5. Only then proceed to next task

**Example Workflow**:
```
Daemon pushes code → GitHub Actions run → CI fails (test failure)
↓
Daemon detects failure via `gh run list`
↓
Daemon reads logs via `gh run view --log-failed`
↓
Daemon fixes the test
↓
Daemon pushes fix
↓
Daemon waits for CI to pass (polls every 30s)
↓
CI passes ✅ → Daemon continues to next task
```

**Why This Matters**:
- **Prevents broken main**: Don't merge PRs with failing CI
- **Fast feedback**: Fix issues while context is fresh
- **Professional quality**: Passing CI is minimum bar
- **Team productivity**: Broken CI blocks everyone

---

### 12. 🔐 Security Vulnerability Monitoring (Daily Task)

**When**: Daily, first thing in the morning
**Why**: Security vulnerabilities can be exploited - fix immediately

**Priority**: 🚨 **TOP PRIORITY** - Security issues block all other work

**Daily Checklist**:
- [ ] Check GitHub Security tab for Dependabot alerts
- [ ] Review severity (Critical > High > Moderate > Low)
- [ ] For each vulnerability: Assess impact and create fix plan
- [ ] Fix vulnerabilities or document reason for delay
- [ ] Update dependencies with security patches

#### 🚨 Current Active Vulnerabilities (as of 2025-10-09)

**Status**: 5 vulnerabilities detected on default branch (main)
**Link**: https://github.com/Bobain/MonolithicCoffeeMakerAgent/security/dependabot

**Action Required**:
- [ ] **1 HIGH severity vulnerability** - Fix immediately (today)
- [ ] **4 MODERATE severity vulnerabilities** - Fix within 24 hours

**TODO**:
1. [ ] Access GitHub Security tab to identify specific packages and CVEs
2. [ ] For HIGH severity:
   - [ ] Identify affected package and vulnerable version
   - [ ] Check if we're using the vulnerable functionality
   - [ ] Update to patched version or apply mitigation
   - [ ] Run full test suite to verify fix
   - [ ] Commit with security prefix: `security: Fix CVE-XXXX in <package>`
3. [ ] For MODERATE severity (repeat for each):
   - [ ] Identify package and assess impact
   - [ ] Update to patched versions
   - [ ] Test and commit fixes
4. [ ] Verify all alerts resolved on GitHub Security tab
5. [ ] Document any mitigations or reasons for delay

**Priority**: 🚨 **HIGH severity must be fixed before any new feature work**

**Commands**:
```bash
# View security alerts via GitHub web UI
open https://github.com/Bobain/MonolithicCoffeeMakerAgent/security

# Check for vulnerable dependencies (local scan)
pip-audit

# Check specific package for vulnerabilities
pip-audit | grep <package-name>

# Update vulnerable package
pip install --upgrade <package-name>

# Check if update breaks anything
pytest tests/ -v
```

**Workflow for Security Alerts**:

1. **Identify Alert**:
   - Go to GitHub → Security → Dependabot alerts
   - Note severity, affected package, vulnerable version range
   - Read CVE details and impact assessment

2. **Assess Impact**:
   ```bash
   # Check where vulnerable package is used
   grep -r "import <package>" coffee_maker/ tests/

   # Check if we're affected by the vulnerability
   # (some CVEs only affect specific use cases)
   ```

3. **Determine Action**:
   - **Critical/High severity**: Fix immediately (drop everything)
   - **Moderate severity**: Fix within 24 hours
   - **Low severity**: Fix within 1 week

4. **Fix Options**:

   **Option A: Update Dependency** (Preferred)
   ```bash
   # Update to patched version
   pip install --upgrade <package>==<safe-version>

   # Update requirements.txt
   pip freeze | grep <package> >> requirements.txt

   # Test everything
   pytest tests/ -v
   black coffee_maker/ tests/
   mypy coffee_maker/
   ```

   **Option B: Wait for Third-Party Fix**
   If vulnerability is in a dependency we can't easily update:
   ```markdown
   # Create tracking issue
   Title: [SECURITY] Waiting for <package> security patch

   Description:
   - CVE: CVE-2024-XXXXX
   - Severity: High
   - Affected package: <package> <version>
   - Our mitigation: <describe workaround>
   - Tracking: <link to upstream issue>
   - ETA: <expected patch date>
   ```

   **Option C: Replace Dependency**
   If patch isn't available and risk is high:
   ```bash
   # Find alternative package
   pip search <alternative>

   # Ask user permission to replace dependency
   # (DAEMON MUST ASK PERMISSION - Section 9)
   ```

   **Option D: Mitigate Risk**
   If we can't update immediately:
   ```python
   # Add input validation
   # Disable vulnerable feature
   # Add rate limiting
   # Add monitoring/alerts
   ```

5. **Test Fix**:
   ```bash
   # Run full test suite
   pytest tests/ -v --cov=coffee_maker

   # Check for breaking changes
   python -m coffee_maker.cli.project_manager --version

   # Manual smoke test of critical features
   ```

6. **Document Fix**:
   ```bash
   git add requirements.txt
   git commit -m "security: Fix CVE-2024-XXXXX in <package>

   - Updated <package> from <old> to <new>
   - CVE severity: <High/Moderate/Low>
   - Impact: <describe what was vulnerable>
   - Tests: All passing

   Fixes: #<issue-number>"

   git push
   ```

7. **Verify on GitHub**:
   - GitHub Security tab should show alert as resolved
   - Dependabot should close the alert automatically
   - If not, manually dismiss with explanation

**🤖 DAEMON REQUIREMENT**:
The autonomous daemon **MUST** check security alerts daily and prioritize fixes:

1. **Every morning (00:00 UTC)**:
   - Check GitHub Security tab (via GitHub API)
   - Count alerts by severity
   - If Critical/High alerts exist: **PAUSE ALL OTHER WORK**

2. **Security-First Priority**:
   ```
   Critical/High vulnerability detected → STOP current task
   ↓
   Assess vulnerability impact
   ↓
   IF fix available: Apply update + test + commit + push
   IF no fix: Document mitigation + notify user
   ↓
   Verify alert resolved on GitHub
   ↓
   Resume previous task
   ```

3. **User Notification**:
   ```
   🚨 SECURITY ALERT: Critical vulnerability detected

   Package: requests==2.28.0
   CVE: CVE-2024-12345
   Severity: HIGH (8.5/10)

   Impact: Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)
   Fix available: requests==2.31.0

   Action: Updating dependency and running tests...
   [Progress bar]
   ✅ Fixed and verified. All tests passing.

   Commit: abc1234
   Branch: security/fix-requests-ssrf
   PR: #456
   ```

**Automation Script** (Future):
```python
# File: scripts/check_security_alerts.py
"""
Daily security alert checker.
Run: python scripts/check_security_alerts.py
"""

import requests
import os

GITHUB_TOKEN = os.environ.get("GITHUB_TOKEN")
REPO = "Bobain/MonolithicCoffeeMakerAgent"

def check_security_alerts():
    """Check GitHub Dependabot alerts."""
    url = f"https://api.github.com/repos/{REPO}/dependabot/alerts"
    headers = {"Authorization": f"token {GITHUB_TOKEN}"}

    response = requests.get(url, headers=headers)
    alerts = response.json()

    # Filter by severity
    critical = [a for a in alerts if a['security_advisory']['severity'] == 'critical']
    high = [a for a in alerts if a['security_advisory']['severity'] == 'high']

    if critical or high:
        print(f"🚨 {len(critical)} critical, {len(high)} high severity alerts!")
        return False
    else:
        print("✅ No critical/high security alerts")
        return True

if __name__ == "__main__":
    check_security_alerts()
```

**Example: Current Alerts (2025-10-09)**:
As of the last push, GitHub reported:
- 1 High severity vulnerability
- 4 Moderate severity vulnerabilities

**Next actions**:
1. Review: https://github.com/Bobain/MonolithicCoffeeMakerAgent/security/dependabot
2. Fix high severity issue immediately
3. Schedule moderate severity fixes within 24 hours

**Why This Matters**:
- **Prevents exploits**: Unpatched vulnerabilities = attack surface
- **Compliance**: Many organizations require <24h fix for high severity
- **Reputation**: Security issues damage trust
- **Legal risk**: Data breaches have legal consequences
- **Supply chain security**: Dependencies can be compromised

**Golden Rule**: When in doubt, fix security issues before features 🔐

### 13. 🔄 Daily Refactoring Opportunity Review

**When**: Daily, after completing any feature or update
**Why**: Small, incremental refactoring prevents technical debt accumulation

**Philosophy**: "Leave code cleaner than you found it" - Every change is an opportunity to improve

**Daily Questions to Ask**:

1. **Does this update create duplication?**
   ```python
   # BAD: Duplicated logic in two places
   def process_user_data(data):
       if data.get('name'):
           cleaned_name = data['name'].strip().lower()
           # ... 20 more lines ...

   def process_admin_data(data):
       if data.get('name'):
           cleaned_name = data['name'].strip().lower()  # DUPLICATE!
           # ... 20 more lines ...

   # GOOD: Extract common logic
   def clean_name(name: str) -> str:
       return name.strip().lower()

   def process_user_data(data):
       if data.get('name'):
           cleaned_name = clean_name(data['name'])
   ```

2. **Can this logic be simplified?**
   ```python
   # BAD: Overly complex
   def is_valid_user(user):
       if user is not None:
           if user.get('active'):
               if user.get('verified'):
                   return True
       return False

   # GOOD: Simplified
   def is_valid_user(user):
       return (user is not None
               and user.get('active', False)
               and user.get('verified', False))
   ```

3. **Are there new patterns that could be utilities?**
   ```python
   # If you find yourself writing similar code 3+ times:
   # → Extract to utility function or decorator

   # Example: Retry pattern repeated across multiple functions
   # → Already extracted to @with_retry decorator ✅
   ```

4. **Do function/variable names clearly communicate intent?**
   ```python
   # BAD: Unclear names
   def f(d):
       r = []
       for x in d:
           if x['s'] == 'active':
               r.append(x)
       return r

   # GOOD: Clear names
   def filter_active_users(users: List[Dict]) -> List[Dict]:
       active_users = []
       for user in users:
           if user['status'] == 'active':
               active_users.append(user)
       return active_users

   # EVEN BETTER: Using comprehension
   def filter_active_users(users: List[Dict]) -> List[Dict]:
       return [u for u in users if u['status'] == 'active']
   ```

5. **Could this be more type-safe?**
   ```python
   # BAD: Weak typing
   def process_data(data):
       return data.get('value', 0) * 2

   # GOOD: Strong typing
   from typing import Dict, Any

   def process_data(data: Dict[str, Any]) -> float:
       value = data.get('value', 0.0)
       return float(value) * 2.0
   ```

6. **Is there dead code or commented-out code?**
   ```python
   # BAD: Leaving commented code "just in case"
   def process_order(order):
       # Old implementation (keeping for reference)
       # result = old_way(order)
       # if result:
       #     return result

       # New implementation
       return new_way(order)

   # GOOD: Remove old code (it's in git history!)
   def process_order(order):
       return new_way(order)
   ```

**Daily Workflow**:

1. **Review Today's Changes**:
   ```bash
   # What did we change today?
   git diff HEAD~1 --stat

   # View actual changes
   git diff HEAD~1
   ```

2. **Identify Opportunities**:
   ```bash
   # Find potential duplication
   ruff check coffee_maker/ --select UP  # pyupgrade suggestions

   # Find code complexity issues
   ruff check coffee_maker/ --select C90  # McCabe complexity

   # Find overly long functions
   ruff check coffee_maker/ --select PLR0915  # too many statements
   ```

3. **Apply Boy Scout Rule**:
   > "Always leave the campground cleaner than you found it"

   If you touch a file:
   - Fix nearby code smells
   - Improve nearby variable names
   - Add missing type hints
   - Add missing docstrings
   - Remove unused imports

4. **Document Refactoring in Commit**:
   ```bash
   git commit -m "refactor: Simplify user validation logic

   - Extracted clean_name() utility (removes duplication)
   - Simplified is_valid_user() (reduced complexity)
   - Added type hints to process_data()
   - Removed commented-out dead code

   No functional changes, all tests passing."
   ```

**🤖 DAEMON REQUIREMENT**:
After implementing any feature, the daemon **MUST** review code for refactoring opportunities:

```
Implement feature → Tests pass → Daemon analyzes changes
↓
Questions:
- Is there duplication? (>2 similar blocks)
- Is there complexity? (functions >50 lines, nested >3 levels)
- Are there unclear names? (single letter variables, abbreviations)
- Is typing incomplete? (missing type hints)
↓
IF opportunities found:
  Create refactoring subtask
  Apply Boy Scout Rule
  Test again
  Commit refactoring separately
↓
Move to next task
```

**Example: Sprint 1 Refactoring Success** ✅

After implementing analytics features, we reviewed and found:
- **Duplication**: Retry logic repeated 5 times → Extracted `@with_retry` decorator
- **Complexity**: 800+ lines of deprecated code → Removed
- **Naming**: Unclear function names → Renamed for clarity
- **Result**: Cleaner codebase, easier maintenance

**Metrics to Track**:
```bash
# Code complexity (aim for <10 per function)
radon cc coffee_maker/ -s

# Maintainability index (aim for A/B grade)
radon mi coffee_maker/ -s

# Lines of code (should not grow unnecessarily)
cloc coffee_maker/
```

**When NOT to Refactor**:
- ❌ Right before a deadline
- ❌ When changing external API contracts (breaking changes)
- ❌ Large-scale refactoring without planning
- ❌ "Clever" optimizations without profiling

**When TO Refactor**:
- ✅ After adding a feature (clean up while context is fresh)
- ✅ When you notice duplication (3rd occurrence → extract)
- ✅ When tests are green (safe to refactor)
- ✅ Small, incremental improvements (not big rewrites)

**Tools**:
- `ruff check` - Find code quality issues
- `radon` - Measure complexity and maintainability
- `black` - Auto-format (eliminates style debates)
- `mypy` - Type checking (catch errors early)

**Golden Rules**:
1. 🔒 **Never refactor without tests** - Tests are safety net
2. 🔬 **One refactoring at a time** - Small, focused changes
3. 📝 **Separate refactoring commits** - Don't mix with features
4. ✅ **Tests must stay green** - No functional changes during refactor
5. 🎯 **Boy Scout Rule** - Always leave code cleaner

**This prevents technical debt accumulation** - 10 minutes daily saves hours later! ⏰

## Summary: Apply These Every Implementation Cycle

1. **Before starting**: Review database sync strategy (PRIORITY 1.5)
2. **During implementation**: Add `@observe` and `@with_retry` decorators
3. **During implementation**: Extract duplicated code to utilities
4. **After implementation**: Update documentation and type hints
5. **Before commit**: Run tests, linting, formatting
6. **After commit**: Update ROADMAP.md status
7. **After push**: Check GitHub Actions CI status and fix any failures ⚡ **NEW**
8. **After feature/update**: Review for refactoring opportunities (Section 13) 🔄 ⚡ **NEW**
9. **After PRIORITY completion**: Create demo + notify user ⚡ **NEW**
10. **Weekly**: Review for refactoring opportunities
11. **Monthly**: Dependency updates and security audit
12. **Daily (TOP PRIORITY)**: Check security vulnerabilities and fix immediately (Section 12) 🔐 ⚡ **NEW**
13. **Daily**: Monitor GitHub CI/CD status (Section 11) ⚡ **NEW**
14. **Daily**: Review if last update adds refactoring opportunities (Section 13) 🔄 ⚡ **NEW**

**🤖 For Autonomous Daemon** (Critical - Non-Negotiable):
- ⚠️ **NEVER STOP ASKING PERMISSION** - This is the CORE PRINCIPLE ⚡
- ⚠️ **ALWAYS ask permission before adding new dependencies**
- ⚠️ **ALWAYS ask permission before making architectural changes**
- ⚠️ **ALWAYS ask permission before breaking changes**
- ⚠️ **ALWAYS ask permission before external API calls**
- Explain why the action is needed
- Provide alternatives when possible
- Wait for user approval (1 hour timeout)
- Never proceed without explicit approval
- ⚠️ **ALWAYS create demo after completing a PRIORITY**

**🔴 CORE PRINCIPLE**: Permission-First Architecture
- This MUST be in MVP (version 0.1.0)
- This MUST be in every published version
- This is NON-NEGOTIABLE for ethical AI
- Daemon is powerful assistant, NOT autonomous overlord

**Goal**: Every feature leaves the codebase cleaner than before ✨

---

### 🎬 Demo & Notification After Priority Completion ⚡ **REQUIRED**

**When**: After completing ANY PRIORITY (before moving to next)

**Why**: User needs to understand what was built and how to use it

**What to Create**:

#### Option A: Interactive Demo (Preferred) 🌟
Create a runnable demonstration showing the new feature in action.

**Format**:
- Jupyter notebook (`.ipynb`) with code + explanations
- Python script with rich terminal output
- Video recording (screen capture with narration)
- GIF animations showing key interactions

**Example** (PRIORITY 2: Project Manager UI):
```bash
# File: demos/priority_2_project_manager_demo.py
"""
Interactive Demo: Project Manager UI

This demo shows how to use the new Project Manager UI to:
1. View roadmap and daemon status
2. Respond to daemon notifications
3. Approve/reject dependency requests

Run: python demos/priority_2_project_manager_demo.py
"""

from rich.console import Console
from rich.panel import Panel
from rich.table import Table

console = Console()

# Demo 1: View Roadmap
console.print(Panel("[bold cyan]Demo 1: Viewing Roadmap[/]"))
# ... runnable code ...

# Demo 2: Respond to Notification
console.print(Panel("[bold cyan]Demo 2: Responding to Daemon[/]"))
# ... runnable code ...
```

#### Option B: Documentation (Minimum) 📝
If interactive demo isn't feasible, create comprehensive documentation.

**Format**: Markdown file with:
- Overview of what was built
- Key features and capabilities
- Usage examples (code snippets)
- Screenshots/GIFs of UI
- Troubleshooting tips

**Template**:
```markdown

### 🤖 Daemon Implementation

**Step-by-Step Process**:

```python
# In coffee_maker/autonomous/minimal_daemon.py

async def complete_priority(self, priority_name: str):
    """Complete a priority with demo and notification."""

    # 1. Run final tests
    self.run_tests()

    # 2. Create demo
    demo_path = self.create_demo(priority_name)

    # 3. Generate summary
    summary = self.generate_priority_summary(
        priority_name=priority_name,
        files_changed=self.get_changed_files(),
        lines_added=self.count_lines_added(),
        tests_passing=self.count_tests()
    )

    # 4. Create PR
    pr_url = self.create_pull_request(
        title=f"feat: Complete {priority_name}",
        body=summary + f"\n\nDemo: {demo_path}"
    )

    # 5. Notify user
    self.notify_user_completion(
        priority_name=priority_name,
        demo_path=demo_path,
        pr_url=pr_url,
        summary=summary
    )

    # 6. Update ROADMAP.md
    self.update_roadmap_status(priority_name, "✅ Completed")

    # 7. Wait for user to review before starting next priority
    response = self.wait_for_user_approval(
        message=f"{priority_name} complete. Review PR and demo. Start next priority?",
        timeout=86400  # 24 hours
    )

    if response == "approved":
        self.move_to_next_priority()
    else:
        self.pause_daemon(reason="Waiting for user feedback on completed priority")
```

**Demo Creation**:

```python
def create_demo(self, priority_name: str) -> str:
    """Create demo for completed priority."""

    demo_dir = Path(f"demos/{self.sanitize_name(priority_name)}")
    demo_dir.mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)

    # Generate README with summary
    readme = self.generate_demo_readme(priority_name)
    (demo_dir / "README.md").write_text(readme)

    # Try to create interactive demo
    try:
        demo_script = self.generate_demo_script(priority_name)
        (demo_dir / "demo.py").write_text(demo_script)
    except Exception as e:
        logger.warning(f"Could not generate interactive demo: {e}")

    # Capture screenshots if UI changes
    if self.has_ui_changes(priority_name):
        self.capture_screenshots(demo_dir / "screenshots")

    return str(demo_dir / "README.md")
```

- [ ] **Tested**: DOD tests below pass
- [ ] **Integrated**: Works with existing User Story system
- [ ] **Documented**: PR tracking workflow documented
- [ ] **User-Tested**: project_manager can identify what needs approval without checking GitHub web UI

**DOD Tests**:
```yaml
tests:
  - name: "PR list command exists"
    type: "command"
    command: "poetry run project-manager --help"
    expected_exit_code: 0
    expected_output_contains: "pr"

      tracker = PRTracker()
      prs = tracker.list_open_prs()
      # Should return list (may be empty if no PRs)
      assert isinstance(prs, list)

    type: "python"
    code: |
      from coffee_maker.cli.pr_tracker import PRTracker
      tracker = PRTracker()
      # Should be able to extract US ID from PR title or branch
      us_id = tracker.extract_user_story_id("feature/US-003-pr-tracking")
      assert us_id == "US-003"

    type: "file_exists"
    files:
      - "docs/PR_TRACKING.md"
      - "coffee_maker/cli/pr_tracker.py"
```

**Technical Notes**:
- Use GitHub API (PyGithub) to fetch PR data
- Parse PR titles/descriptions for User Story IDs (US-XXX format)
- Store PR approval status in notification DB or separate tracking
- Integrate with existing /test-dod command for User Stories
- PR labels could indicate status: "needs-review", "needs-user-testing"

**Related Stories**: US-001 (GCP Deploy), US-002 (Health Score)

**Implementation Approach**:
1. Create `coffee_maker/cli/pr_tracker.py` module
2. Add `/pr` command to CLI command registry
3. Integrate with GitHub API to fetch PR data
4. Parse PR metadata to identify User Story links
5. Determine approval status based on labels, reviews, CI status
6. Display clear status for each PR (in-dev, needs-review, needs-testing)
7. For "needs-testing" PRs, show DOD checklist and allow running tests

**Workflow Example**:
```bash
# List all PRs
project-manager pr list

Output:
📋 Open Pull Requests (3)

### 🎯 [US-004] Use Claude CLI instead of Anthropic API for code_developer

**As a**: User with a Claude subscription (€200/month)
**I want**: code_developer to use an isolated Claude CLI session for API calls
**So that**: I don't need to pay for separate API credits when I already have Claude access through my subscription

**Business Value**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
**Estimated Effort**: 3 story points (2-3 days)
**Status**: 🚨 Critical - Blocking daemon operation

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] code_developer uses Claude CLI instead of Anthropic API SDK
- [ ] Daemon runs in isolated environment/process to avoid conflicts with user's Claude CLI sessions
- [ ] User can continue using Claude CLI separately (but not simultaneously)
- [ ] No API credits required - uses existing Claude subscription
- [ ] Configuration option to choose between Claude CLI and Anthropic API
- [ ] Clear documentation on when to use each mode
- [ ] Error handling when Claude CLI is not available

**Definition of Done**:
- [ ] **Functional**: code_developer works with Claude CLI
- [ ] **Tested**: DOD tests below pass
- [ ] **Documented**: Setup instructions for Claude CLI mode
- [ ] **Cost-Effective**: No API credits needed
- [ ] **User-Tested**: Daemon runs successfully without API credit errors

**DOD Tests**:
```yaml
tests:
  - name: "Claude CLI mode configuration exists"
    type: "python"
    code: |
      from coffee_maker.autonomous.claude_cli_interface import ClaudeCLIInterface
      # Should be able to initialize Claude CLI interface
      interface = ClaudeCLIInterface()
      assert interface is not None

  - name: "Can detect Claude CLI availability"
    type: "python"
    code: |
      from coffee_maker.autonomous.claude_cli_interface import ClaudeCLIInterface
      interface = ClaudeCLIInterface()
      # Should check if claude command exists
      available = interface.is_available()
      assert isinstance(available, bool)

  - name: "Can send prompt to Claude CLI"
    type: "python"
    code: |
      from coffee_maker.autonomous.claude_cli_interface import ClaudeCLIInterface
      interface = ClaudeCLIInterface()
      if interface.is_available():
          response = interface.send_prompt("Hello, respond with 'test'")
          assert isinstance(response, str)
          assert len(response) > 0

  - name: "Daemon can use Claude CLI mode"
    type: "command"
    command: "poetry run code-developer --help"
    expected_exit_code: 0
    expected_output_contains: "--use-cli"

  - name: "Documentation exists"
    type: "file_exists"
    files:
      - "docs/CLAUDE_CLI_MODE.md"
      - "coffee_maker/autonomous/claude_cli_interface.py"
```

**Technical Notes**:
- Create `ClaudeCLIInterface` class parallel to `ClaudeAPIInterface`
- Use subprocess to call `claude` command with prompts
- Parse Claude CLI output (may need special handling for streaming)
- Add `--use-cli` flag to code-developer command
- Detect Claude CLI availability: `which claude` or check if command exists
- Handle non-interactive mode: use heredoc or pipe for input
- Isolation: Run daemon in separate terminal or use process management

**Current Blocker**:
- User has Claude subscription (€200/month) via Claude CLI
- Anthropic API requires separate credits ($$$)
- This US removes the blocker by using existing Claude access

**Related Stories**:
- US-001 (GCP Deploy) - will also need Claude CLI mode for cloud
- US-003 (PR Tracking) - daemon PRs will use Claude CLI

**Technical Feasibility Investigation** ✅ **CONFIRMED**:

Investigation conducted on 2025-10-10 - Claude CLI programmatic usage **CONFIRMED WORKING**:

```bash
# Test 1: Basic programmatic usage
$ echo "What is 2+2? Respond with just the number." | claude -p
4

# Test 2: Verify claude path
$ which claude
/opt/homebrew/bin/claude

# Test 3: Review available options
$ claude --help
# Key options found:
#   -p, --print               Non-interactive output
#   --dangerously-skip-permissions  Skip permission dialogs
#   --output-format          text, json, stream-json
#   --model                  Specify Claude model
#   --add-dir                Add directories for tool access
```

✅ **Verdict**: Claude CLI can be used programmatically via subprocess with pipes.

**Key Design Decision**: ClaudeCLIInterface **matches ClaudeAPI's interface exactly**:
- Same `execute_prompt()` method signature
- Same `APIResult` return type
- Same `check_available()` method
- This allows **drop-in replacement** - daemon doesn't need to know which backend it's using

### 2. Update DevDaemon to Support CLI Mode

**File**: `coffee_maker/autonomous/daemon.py`

**Modifications needed**:

```python
# In __init__ method (line 63):

    roadmap_path: str = "docs/ROADMAP.md",
    auto_approve: bool = False,

    self.notifications = NotificationDB()

    # ... rest of init unchanged
```

**Impact**: Minimal changes to daemon logic. Only the initialization differs.

### 3. Update daemon_cli.py

**File**: `coffee_maker/autonomous/daemon_cli.py`

**Modifications needed** (around line 66-102):

```python
# Add new arguments:

parser.add_argument(
    "--use-cli",
    action="store_true",
    help="Use Claude CLI instead of Anthropic API (uses subscription, not API credits)"

    use_claude_cli=args.use_cli,  # NEW
    claude_cli_path=args.claude_path,  # NEW
)

daemon.run()
```

### 4. Isolation Strategy: Repository Copy Approach

As suggested by user, for the first prototype:

**Setup (one-time)**:
```bash
# 1. Create isolated copy for daemon
cd /path/to/projects
git clone /path/to/MonolithicCoffeeMakerAgent MonolithicCoffeeMakerAgent-daemon
cd MonolithicCoffeeMakerAgent-daemon

# 2. Install dependencies
poetry install

# 3. Copy environment file (if needed)
cp ../MonolithicCoffeeMakerAgent/.env .env

# 4. Create roadmap-sync branch (shared sync point)
git checkout -b roadmap-sync
git push -u origin roadmap-sync

# 5. Run daemon in CLI mode
poetry run code-developer --use-cli --auto-approve
```

**ROADMAP Synchronization Strategy** 🔄 **Git-Based Sync**:

Instead of complex file synchronization systems, use a dedicated **`roadmap-sync` branch** for ROADMAP coordination:

```
Git Branch Strategy:
├── main (production)
├── feature/* (feature branches created by code_developer)
└── roadmap-sync (ROADMAP synchronization branch)
    ↑
    ├─ project_manager pushes ROADMAP updates here
    ├─ code_developer pulls ROADMAP from here
    └─ code_developer pushes ROADMAP status updates here
```

**Workflow - project_manager updates ROADMAP**:
```bash
# User repo (Terminal 1)
cd /path/to/MonolithicCoffeeMakerAgent

# Make changes via project-manager
poetry run project-manager chat
> "Mark PRIORITY 3 as complete"

# project_manager auto-commits and pushes to roadmap-sync
git checkout roadmap-sync
git add docs/ROADMAP.md
git commit -m "feat: Mark PRIORITY 3 complete"
git push origin roadmap-sync
```

**Workflow - code_developer syncs ROADMAP**:
```bash
# Daemon repo (Terminal 2)
cd /path/to/MonolithicCoffeeMakerAgent-daemon

# code_developer pulls latest ROADMAP before each iteration
git checkout roadmap-sync
git pull origin roadmap-sync

# Read updated ROADMAP
# Implement next priority
# Update ROADMAP status
git add docs/ROADMAP.md
git commit -m "feat: Update ROADMAP - PRIORITY 4 in progress"
git push origin roadmap-sync

# Create feature branch and PR as normal
git checkout -b feature/priority-4
# ... implementation work ...
git push origin feature/priority-4
# Create PR from feature/priority-4 → main
```

**Conflict Resolution**:
If both project_manager and code_developer modify ROADMAP simultaneously:

```bash
# code_developer encounters merge conflict
git pull origin roadmap-sync
# CONFLICT in docs/ROADMAP.md

# Auto-resolve: prefer project_manager changes (user authority)
git checkout --theirs docs/ROADMAP.md
git add docs/ROADMAP.md
git commit -m "merge: Sync ROADMAP from project_manager"
git push origin roadmap-sync

# Or: Manual resolution if both changes are important
# Edit docs/ROADMAP.md to combine changes
```

**Implementation in code_developer**:
```python
# In coffee_maker/autonomous/daemon.py

class DevDaemon:
    def run(self):
        """Run daemon with ROADMAP sync."""
        while self.running:
            # 1. Sync ROADMAP before iteration
            self._sync_roadmap_from_branch()

            # 2. Parse ROADMAP
            self.parser = RoadmapParser(str(self.roadmap_path))

            # 3. Get next priority
            next_priority = self.parser.get_next_planned_priority()

            # 4. Implement priority
            if next_priority:
                self._implement_priority(next_priority)

                # 5. Update ROADMAP status
                self._update_roadmap_status(next_priority, "✅ Complete")

                # 6. Push ROADMAP update to sync branch
                self._push_roadmap_to_branch()

    def _sync_roadmap_from_branch(self):
        """Pull latest ROADMAP from roadmap-sync branch."""
        try:
            # Switch to roadmap-sync branch
            self.git.run_command("git checkout roadmap-sync")

            # Pull latest changes
            self.git.run_command("git pull origin roadmap-sync")

            logger.info("✅ ROADMAP synced from roadmap-sync branch")
        except Exception as e:
            logger.warning(f"⚠️  ROADMAP sync failed: {e}")
            # Continue with local ROADMAP

    def _push_roadmap_to_branch(self):
        """Push ROADMAP updates to roadmap-sync branch."""
        try:
            # Ensure on roadmap-sync branch
            self.git.run_command("git checkout roadmap-sync")

            # Stage ROADMAP changes
            self.git.run_command("git add docs/ROADMAP.md")

            # Commit with clear message
            message = "feat: Update ROADMAP - daemon status sync"
            self.git.run_command(f'git commit -m "{message}"')

            # Push to remote
            self.git.run_command("git push origin roadmap-sync")

            logger.info("✅ ROADMAP updates pushed to roadmap-sync")
        except Exception as e:
            logger.warning(f"⚠️  ROADMAP push failed: {e}")
```

**Benefits**:
- ✅ **Simple**: Just Git commands, no custom sync system
- ✅ **Audit Trail**: Full history in Git log
- ✅ **Conflict Resolution**: Git's merge tools handle conflicts
- ✅ **Isolation**: Works with repository copy approach
- ✅ **Rollback**: Can revert ROADMAP changes via Git
- ✅ **No Polling**: Pull-based, no file watching needed

**Trade-offs**:
- ⚠️ Requires network access (GitHub)
- ⚠️ Small delay for sync (acceptable for async daemon)
- ⚠️ Merge conflicts possible (but Git handles them)

**Why This Is The Permanent Solution** ✅:

This Git-based sync approach is **NOT just a prototype** - it's the recommended long-term solution:

1. **Simple > Complex**: Uses proven Git infrastructure, no custom sync system
2. **Performance**: 1 pull/push per 2-3 days (daemon iteration) = negligible overhead
3. **Offline**: Not needed (daemon requires Claude API = always online)
4. **Conflicts**: Rare (user changes priorities, daemon changes status = orthogonal)
5. **Scalability**: Easily extends to multiple daemons or team members via branch strategy
6. **Evolution**: Can add webhooks, CI/CD, branch protection without changing architecture

**Future Enhancements** (additive, not replacement):
- GitHub webhooks to notify daemon of ROADMAP changes (instant sync)
- CI/CD to validate ROADMAP syntax before merge (prevent bugs)
- Branch protection rules for roadmap-sync (require reviews)
- Web UI to visualize roadmap-sync history (GitHub already provides this)
- Multiple sync branches for team collaboration (roadmap-sync-alice, roadmap-sync-bob)

### 5. Implementation Steps for code_developer

**Step-by-step plan** (2-3 days):

**Day 1: Create ClaudeCLIInterface**
1. Create `coffee_maker/autonomous/claude_cli_interface.py`
2. Implement `APIResult` dataclass
3. Implement `ClaudeCLIInterface` class:
   - `__init__()`, `is_available()`, `check_available()`
   - `execute_prompt()` with subprocess call to `claude -p`
4. Write unit tests:
   - Test subprocess communication
   - Test error handling
   - Test timeout handling
5. Manual testing: `python -c "from coffee_maker.autonomous.claude_cli_interface import ClaudeCLIInterface; cli = ClaudeCLIInterface(); print(cli.execute_prompt('Hello'))"`

**Day 2: Integrate with DevDaemon**
1. Modify `coffee_maker/autonomous/daemon.py`:
   - Add `use_claude_cli` and `claude_cli_path` parameters
   - Add conditional initialization
2. Modify `coffee_maker/autonomous/daemon_cli.py`:
   - Add `--use-cli` and `--claude-path` arguments
   - Update environment variable checks
   - Update help text
3. Test daemon initialization:
   - `poetry run code-developer --use-cli --help`
   - `poetry run code-developer --use-cli --roadmap docs/ROADMAP.md`
4. Integration testing:
   - Create test ROADMAP with simple priority
   - Run daemon with `--use-cli`
   - Verify it can read roadmap and call Claude CLI

**Day 3: Documentation and Edge Cases**
1. Create `docs/CLAUDE_CLI_MODE.md`:
   - When to use CLI mode vs API mode
   - Setup instructions
   - Isolation strategy (repository copy)
   - Troubleshooting
2. Update README.md with CLI mode instructions
3. Edge case handling:
   - Claude CLI not installed
   - Claude CLI fails mid-execution
   - ANSI code stripping from output (if needed)
   - Timeout handling
4. Run DOD tests (see DOD Tests section above)
5. User testing:
   - User creates repository copy
   - User runs daemon with `--use-cli`
   - Verify no API credit errors
   - Verify daemon can implement simple priority

**Verification Commands**:
```bash
# Check implementation exists
ls -la coffee_maker/autonomous/claude_cli_interface.py

# Check CLI flag works
poetry run code-developer --help | grep "use-cli"

# Check daemon can start
poetry run code-developer --use-cli --no-pr --roadmap docs/ROADMAP.md

# Check documentation exists
ls -la docs/CLAUDE_CLI_MODE.md
```

**Workflow Example**:
```bash
# Before (requires API credits - doesn't work):
poetry run code-developer --auto-approve
# Error: API credits insufficient

# After (uses Claude CLI - works!):
poetry run code-developer --use-cli --auto-approve
# ✅ Uses existing Claude subscription, no API credits needed

# Configuration via environment:
export CODE_DEVELOPER_MODE=cli
poetry run code-developer --auto-approve
```

**Benefits**:
- ✅ No additional costs (uses existing €200/month subscription)
- ✅ Same Claude models available
- ✅ No API key management needed
- ✅ Works immediately without credit setup

**Considerations**:
- User should not use Claude CLI simultaneously (to avoid credential conflicts)
- Claude CLI has rate limits (but sufficient for daemon use)
- Need to handle Claude CLI output parsing (may include ANSI codes, formatting)
- Non-interactive mode required for automation

### 🎯 [US-007] IDE Code Completion from code_developer Accumulated Knowledge

**As a**: Developer using this project
**I want**: Code completion in my IDE that leverages code_developer's accumulated knowledge of the entire codebase
**So that**: I can write code faster with intelligent suggestions based on the project's patterns, conventions, and architecture

**Business Value**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐
**Estimated Effort**: 5-8 story points (1-2 weeks)
**Status**: 📝 Planned
**Sprint**: 🎯 **Sprint 8 or 9** (Nov 2025) - **Post-MVP**

**Problem Statement**:
Currently, IDE code completion (IntelliSense, etc.) provides generic suggestions based on:
- Standard library APIs
- Type definitions and imports
- Simple pattern matching

However, it doesn't understand:
- Project-specific patterns and conventions
- Architecture decisions documented in ROADMAP
- Common implementation patterns used across the codebase
- Technical decisions made by code_developer during autonomous development

**Proposed Solution**:
Create a Language Server Protocol (LSP) extension that:
1. Indexes code_developer's commit history and PR descriptions
2. Analyzes ROADMAP.md for architecture decisions and patterns
3. Learns project-specific conventions from existing code
4. Provides context-aware completions based on this knowledge

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] LSP server runs alongside IDE (VS Code, PyCharm, etc.)
- [ ] Completions include project-specific patterns
- [ ] Completions reference ROADMAP context when relevant
- [ ] Completions learn from code_developer's previous implementations
- [ ] Performance: <100ms response time for completions
- [ ] Integration: Works with major IDEs (VS Code, PyCharm, Neovim)

**Technical Approach**:

**Phase 1: Knowledge Extraction** (Week 1)
- Parse git history for code_developer commits
- Extract patterns from PR descriptions and commit messages
- Index ROADMAP.md architecture decisions
- Build codebase knowledge graph

**Phase 2: LSP Server Implementation** (Week 2)
- Implement Python LSP server
- Integrate with Anthropic API for intelligent suggestions
- Cache common completions for performance
- Support incremental updates as code changes

**Phase 3: IDE Integration** (Week 2)
- VS Code extension
- PyCharm plugin (via LSP)
- Neovim/Vim integration
- Configuration and setup documentation

**Example Use Cases**:

**Use Case 1**: Architecture Pattern Completion
```python
# User types:
from coffee_maker.cli import

# Completion suggests (based on ROADMAP):
from coffee_maker.cli import RoadmapEditor  # ✅ Part of project-manager architecture
from coffee_maker.cli import ChatSession    # ✅ US-006 implementation pattern
from coffee_maker.cli import AIService      # ✅ Follows project conventions
```

**Use Case 2**: Convention-Aware Suggestions
```python
# User types:
def test_daemon_

# Completion suggests (based on code_developer patterns):
def test_daemon_initialization():        # ✅ Common test pattern in this project
def test_daemon_error_handling():        # ✅ Follows project test conventions
def test_daemon_cli_integration():       # ✅ Matches existing test structure
```

**Use Case 3**: ROADMAP-Informed Completions
```python
# User types in comment:
# TODO: Implement

# Completion suggests (based on ROADMAP planned priorities):
# TODO: Implement PRIORITY 2.7 - Daemon crash recovery
# TODO: Implement US-008 - Multi-provider AI support
# TODO: Implement GCP deployment (US-001)
```

**Technical Architecture**:

│  │  - Anthropic API (optional)             │  │
│  └──────────────────────────────────────────┘  │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Dependencies**:
```toml
# New dependencies for LSP server
pygls = "^1.3.0"              # Python Language Server Protocol
lsprotocol = "^2023.0.0"      # LSP types and protocol
tree-sitter = "^0.21.0"       # Fast code parsing
tree-sitter-python = "^0.21.0"
```

**Implementation Files**:
- `coffee_maker/lsp/server.py` - Main LSP server
- `coffee_maker/lsp/knowledge_graph.py` - Knowledge extraction
- `coffee_maker/lsp/completion_provider.py` - Completion engine
- `extensions/vscode/` - VS Code extension
- `docs/LSP_SETUP.md` - Setup instructions

**Success Criteria**:
- ✅ Completions are 30%+ more relevant than standard IDE completions
- ✅ Users report faster coding with project-aware suggestions
- ✅ LSP server performs well (no lag in IDE)
- ✅ Works across major IDEs without issues

**Challenges & Risks**:
- **Performance**: Indexing large codebases may be slow
  - Mitigation: Incremental indexing, caching
- **LSP Complexity**: Protocol implementation is non-trivial
  - Mitigation: Use pygls library, start with basic features
- **IDE Compatibility**: Different IDEs have different LSP support
  - Mitigation: Focus on VS Code first, expand later

**Future Enhancements** (Post-MVP):
- AI-powered code generation (full function/class suggestions)
- Refactoring suggestions based on ROADMAP architecture
- Live sync with code_developer daemon (get suggestions from running daemon)
- Team knowledge sharing (multiple developers' patterns)

**Related Stories**:
- Complements US-004 (Uses code_developer's work history)
- Enhances developer productivity (main value proposition)
- Could integrate with US-003 (Learn from PR patterns)

### 🎯 [US-008] Automated User Support Assistant for Code Help Requests

**As a**: Developer
**I want**: An assistant program that automatically helps users with code completion and feature implementation requests
**So that**: I don't have to manually respond when users ask for help with their code or feature implementations

**Business Value**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
**Estimated Effort**: 5-8 story points (1-2 weeks)
**Status**: 📝 Planned
**Sprint**: 🎯 **Sprint 8 or 9** (Nov 2025) - **High Impact**

**Problem Statement**:
As a developer, I frequently receive requests from users like:
- "Please help me complete my code"
- "Can you implement feature X for me?"
- "I need help with the codebase"

Currently, I have to manually:
- Read the user's code context
- Understand what they need
- Provide code suggestions or implementations
- Explain the solution

This is time-consuming and takes me away from my core development work.

**Proposed Solution**:
Create an automated assistant that:
1. Monitors user requests (via chat, issues, or dedicated channel)
2. Analyzes the user's code context and request
3. Leverages code_developer's knowledge of the codebase
4. Provides intelligent code suggestions or implementations
5. Explains the solution in user-friendly terms

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] Assistant monitors input channels (chat, GitHub issues, Discord, etc.)
- [ ] Understands user's code context (files, current implementation)
- [ ] Provides relevant code suggestions based on codebase patterns
- [ ] Explains solutions clearly (not just code dumps)
- [ ] Can implement small features autonomously
- [ ] Escalates complex requests to developer when needed
- [ ] Tracks user satisfaction with responses

**Technical Approach**:

**Phase 1: Input Integration** (Week 1)
- Monitor project-manager chat for help requests
- GitHub Issues integration (watch for "help wanted" label)
- Discord/Slack webhook support (optional)
- Email integration (support@ address)

**Phase 2: Context Analysis** (Week 1)
- Parse user's code snippets
- Identify relevant files from codebase
- Extract project context from ROADMAP
- Build request understanding

**Phase 3: Response Generation** (Week 2)
- Use Claude API for code completion
- Leverage code_developer commit history for patterns
- Generate explanations alongside code
- Format responses for readability

**Phase 4: Quality & Escalation** (Week 2)
- Confidence scoring (escalate low confidence)
- User feedback collection
- Analytics on response quality
- Developer notification for escalations

**Example Use Cases**:

**Use Case 1**: Code Completion Request
```
User: "Help me complete this function:
def analyze_roadmap():
    # TODO: Parse ROADMAP.md and extract priorities
"

Assistant Response:
"I can help! Based on your codebase, here's a completion using the existing RoadmapEditor:

```python
def analyze_roadmap():
    from coffee_maker.cli.roadmap_editor import RoadmapEditor

    editor = RoadmapEditor("docs/ROADMAP.md")
    priorities = editor.list_priorities()

    return {
        "total": len(priorities),
        "completed": sum(1 for p in priorities if p["status"] == "✅ Complete"),
        "in_progress": sum(1 for p in priorities if p["status"] == "🔄 In Progress"),
    }
```

This follows the project pattern seen in coffee_maker/cli/roadmap_cli.py:254.
The RoadmapEditor is the standard way to interact with ROADMAP.md in this codebase."
```

**Use Case 2**: Feature Implementation Request
```
User: "I need a command to list all incomplete priorities"

Assistant Response:
"I'll implement this for you. Based on the existing CLI structure, here's the implementation:

1. Add to coffee_maker/cli/commands.py:
```python
class ListIncompleteCommand(Command):
    def execute(self, args, editor):
        priorities = editor.list_priorities()
        incomplete = [p for p in priorities if p["status"] != "✅ Complete"]

        # Display with Rich table
        table = Table(title="Incomplete Priorities")
        table.add_column("Priority", style="cyan")
        table.add_column("Title", style="white")
        table.add_column("Status", style="yellow")

        for p in incomplete:
            table.add_row(p["name"], p["title"], p["status"])

        console = Console()
        console.print(table)
```

2. Register in roadmap_cli.py:
```python
COMMANDS = {
    # ... existing commands ...
    "incomplete": ListIncompleteCommand(),
}
```

This follows the Command pattern used throughout the CLI. Would you like me to create a PR for this?"
```

**Use Case 3**: Escalation to Developer
```
User: "I want to completely redesign the daemon architecture"

Assistant Response:
"This is a significant architectural change that requires human review. I've notified the developer.

Initial thoughts:
- Current daemon uses polling (checks ROADMAP every 30s)
- Alternative: Event-driven with file watchers
- Consider: Impact on ~15 files, testing complexity, deployment changes

I've created Issue #123 with these details. The developer will respond within 24 hours.

For now, is there a smaller improvement I can help with?"
```

**Dependencies**:
```toml
# New dependencies
discord-py = "^2.3.0"           # Discord integration (optional)
slack-sdk = "^3.27.0"           # Slack integration (optional)
pygithub = "^2.8.1"             # Already present (GitHub API)
```

**Implementation Files**:
- `coffee_maker/assistant/server.py` - Main assistant server
- `coffee_maker/assistant/request_parser.py` - Request understanding
- `coffee_maker/assistant/response_generator.py` - Code generation
- `coffee_maker/assistant/escalation.py` - Complexity detection
- `coffee_maker/assistant/integrations/` - Channel integrations
  - `chat_integration.py` - project-manager chat
  - `github_integration.py` - Issues/PRs
  - `discord_integration.py` - Discord bot
  - `slack_integration.py` - Slack bot

**Escalation Criteria**:
Assistant escalates to developer when:
- Confidence score < 0.7 (uncertain)
- Request involves >3 files
- Architectural changes requested
- Security-sensitive code
- User explicitly asks for human review

**Success Criteria**:
- ✅ Handles 80%+ of simple code help requests autonomously
- ✅ Response time < 30 seconds for code completion
- ✅ User satisfaction score > 4/5
- ✅ Escalation accuracy > 90% (correct escalation decisions)
- ✅ Developer time saved: 5+ hours/week

**Metrics to Track**:
- Requests received vs. handled
- Escalation rate
- User satisfaction scores
- Response time distribution
- Code correctness (via user feedback)
- Developer time saved

**Example Configuration**:
```yaml
# assistant_config.yaml
channels:
  chat:
    enabled: true
    max_response_time: 30s
  github:
    enabled: true
    watched_labels: ["help wanted", "question"]
  discord:
    enabled: false  # Optional
    bot_token: ${DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN}
  slack:
    enabled: false  # Optional
    webhook_url: ${SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL}

escalation:
  confidence_threshold: 0.7
  max_files_touched: 3
  notify_via: ["email", "github_issue"]

response:
  max_length: 2000  # Characters
  include_explanations: true
  code_format: markdown
  link_to_docs: true
```

**Challenges & Risks**:
- **Code Quality**: Assistant might suggest suboptimal code
  - Mitigation: Confidence scoring, human review for low scores
- **Context Understanding**: May misunderstand complex requests
  - Mitigation: Ask clarifying questions, escalate when uncertain
- **User Expectations**: Users may expect human-level reasoning
  - Mitigation: Set clear expectations, show confidence scores
- **Integration Complexity**: Multiple channels to support
  - Mitigation: Start with chat only, add others incrementally

**Future Enhancements** (Post-MVP):
- Multi-turn conversations (follow-up questions)
- Voice interface (speak code requests)
- Video tutorial generation (screen recording of implementation)
- Team knowledge sharing (learn from all developers)
- A/B testing different response styles

**Related Stories**:
- Complements US-007 (IDE completion for active coding)
- Uses US-006 (project-manager chat as primary channel)
- Leverages US-004 (code_developer knowledge base)
- Reduces developer support burden (main value)

### 🎯 [US-009] Process Management and Status Monitoring for code_developer

**As a**: project_manager user
**I want to**: Know if the code_developer process is running and see its current status
**So that**: I can watch current progress, send commands, ask questions, and respond to daemon requests

**Business Value**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
**Estimated Effort**: 3-5 story points (1 week)
**Status**: ✅ **COMPLETE** (2025-10-10)
**Sprint**: 🎯 **Sprint 7** (Oct-Nov 2025) - **Critical UX Improvement**

**Problem Statement** (Solved):
Previously, when using project-manager, there was no visibility into whether code_developer was running or what it was doing:
- Had to manually launch code_developer in a separate terminal
- No way to check if the daemon was running
- No visibility into current daemon progress
- No integrated way to send commands to the daemon
- No consolidated view of daemon questions/notifications

This creates a fragmented experience where I need to:
- Switch between terminals to check daemon status
- Manually monitor log files
- Check ROADMAP.md for updates
- Poll notifications database separately

**Proposed Solution**:
Enhance project-manager with integrated process management and status monitoring:

1. **Process Detection & Status**
   - Automatically detect if code_developer is running
   - Show daemon status in chat interface (running/stopped/idle/working)
   - Display current task and progress

2. **Unified Launcher**
   - Single command to launch both processes
   - Automatic daemon startup if not running
   - Graceful shutdown coordination

3. **Progress Monitoring**
   - Real-time view of what daemon is working on
   - Progress indicators for long-running tasks
   - Estimated completion time

4. **Bidirectional Communication**
   - Send commands to daemon from chat
   - Ask daemon questions and get responses
   - Answer daemon questions in-line
   - Unified notification view

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] project-manager detects if code_developer process is running
- [ ] Status displayed in chat (e.g., "🟢 Daemon: Active - Working on PRIORITY 2.6")
- [ ] `/status` command shows detailed daemon information
- [ ] `/start` command launches daemon if not running
- [ ] `/stop` command gracefully stops the daemon
- [ ] Can send commands to daemon via chat (e.g., "Ask daemon to implement PRIORITY X")
- [ ] Can ask daemon questions (e.g., "What's the current progress on US-007?")
- [ ] Daemon questions appear in chat with response interface
- [ ] All notifications integrated into chat flow
- [ ] PID file management for process tracking
- [ ] Graceful shutdown when Ctrl+C pressed

**Implementation Files**:
- `coffee_maker/process_manager.py` - New: Process detection and management
- `coffee_maker/cli/chat_interface.py` - Update: Integrate status display
- `coffee_maker/cli/roadmap_cli.py` - Update: Add start/stop/status commands
- `coffee_maker/autonomous/daemon_cli.py` - Update: Write PID file on startup
- `~/.coffee_maker/daemon.pid` - New: PID file for tracking
- `~/.coffee_maker/daemon_status.json` - New: Current task tracking

**CLI Command Updates**:
```bash
# New commands for roadmap_cli.py

poetry run project-manager status          # Show daemon status
poetry run project-manager start           # Start daemon if not running
poetry run project-manager start --daemon  # Start both (unified launcher)
poetry run project-manager stop            # Stop daemon gracefully
poetry run project-manager chat            # Chat with status display
```

**Dependencies**:
```toml
# pyproject.toml (already present)
psutil = "^7.0.0"  # ✅ Already installed
```

**Example Interactions**:

**Use Case 1: Check Daemon Status**
```
User: /status

project-manager:
🟢 **Daemon Status**
- PID: 12345
- Status: WORKING
- Current Task: PRIORITY 2.6 - CI Testing
- Uptime: 2 hours, 15 minutes
- CPU: 15.3%
- Memory: 245.7 MB

Use /stop to shut down daemon.
```

**Use Case 2: Auto-Start Daemon**
```
User: poetry run project-manager chat

project-manager:
Welcome to Coffee Maker Project Manager! 🤖
Type 'help' for commands, or just chat naturally.

🔴 Daemon: Stopped

Would you like me to start the daemon? (y/n): y

Starting daemon...
✅ Daemon started successfully!

🟢 Daemon: Idle - Waiting for tasks
```

**Use Case 3: Send Command via Chat**
```
User: Ask the daemon to start working on PRIORITY 2.7

project-manager:
✅ Command sent to daemon (notification #42)

The daemon will process this when it next checks notifications.

Use /notifications to monitor responses.

[2 seconds later]
🟢 Daemon: Active - Working on PRIORITY 2.7
```

**Use Case 4: Daemon Asks Question**
```
[Daemon working on task...]

project-manager:
📋 Daemon has a question:

"Should I use pytest or unittest for the new tests?"

Your response: pytest with pytest-cov for coverage

✅ Response sent to daemon.

[Daemon continues with pytest...]
```

**Success Criteria**:
- ✅ 100% accurate daemon status detection
- ✅ Daemon starts within 3 seconds of `/start` command
- ✅ Graceful shutdown completes within 10 seconds
- ✅ Real-time status updates (<1 second latency)
- ✅ All daemon questions visible in chat
- ✅ Commands reliably delivered to daemon
- ✅ Zero orphaned daemon processes

**Metrics to Track**:
- Daemon uptime percentage
- Average startup time
- Shutdown success rate
- Status check latency
- Command delivery success rate
- User satisfaction with visibility

**Challenges & Risks**:
- **Process Detection**: PID files can become stale
  - Mitigation: Verify process name via psutil, clean stale PIDs
- **Cross-Platform**: Process management differs on Windows/Mac/Linux
  - Mitigation: Use psutil for cross-platform compatibility
- **Zombie Processes**: Daemon might not clean up properly
  - Mitigation: Implement graceful shutdown with SIGTERM
- **Race Conditions**: Multiple project-managers starting daemon
  - Mitigation: Use file locking for PID file writes

**Future Enhancements** (Post-MVP):
- Web dashboard for daemon monitoring
- Historical status tracking (uptime, tasks completed)
- Performance metrics (tasks/hour, success rate)
- Email notifications for daemon crashes
- Cluster management (multiple daemons)

**Related Stories**:
- Enables v0.2.0 release (Unified Launcher)
- Required for US-007 (IDE needs daemon status)
- Required for US-008 (Assistant needs daemon coordination)
- Improves US-006 UX (integrated status display)

## 🚀 Prioritized Roadmap

### 🔴 **PRIORITY 1: Analytics & Observability** ⚡ FOUNDATION FOR AUTONOMOUS DAEMON

**Estimated Duration**: 2-3 weeks
**Impact**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
**Status**: 🔄 **MOSTLY COMPLETE** (Core analytics done via Sprint 5, advanced features remaining)
**Why First**: Required for autonomous daemon to track its own work and errors

#### Project: Langfuse → SQLite Export & Analysis

**Core Features** ✅ **COMPLETED via Sprint 5**:

### 🔴 **PRIORITY 1.5: Database Synchronization Architecture** ✅ **COMPLETE**

**Estimated Duration**: 2-3 days (design phase only)
**Impact**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (Critical infrastructure)
**Status**: ✅ **COMPLETE** - Implemented in PRIORITY 2 & 3
**Completed**: 2025-10-09
**Type**: Design-only priority (no implementation, integrated into other priorities)
**Decision**: Hybrid Shared SQLite (Option D) - See ADR_001

**Summary of Completion**:
- ✅ Analyzed database synchronization problem for daemon ↔ user communication
- ✅ Evaluated 4 architecture options (Shared SQLite, Sync, PostgreSQL, Hybrid)
- ✅ **Decision**: Hybrid Shared SQLite with WAL mode for concurrent access
- ✅ Documented in ADR_001_DATABASE_SYNC_STRATEGY.md (431 lines)
- ✅ Implemented in PRIORITY 2 (NotificationDB with WAL, @with_retry)
- ✅ Validated with 27 tests (11 unit + 16 integration)
- ✅ Migration path defined for future PostgreSQL scaling

**Key Implementation Details**:
- Shared SQLite databases in `data/` directory
- WAL (Write-Ahead Logging) mode enabled for multi-process safety
- 30-second busy_timeout for lock handling
- @with_retry decorator for transient failure recovery
- Data ownership matrix defined for all tables
- Concurrency strategy with lock scenario analysis

**Documentation**:
- `docs/PRIORITY_1.5_DATABASE_SYNC_DESIGN.md` - Problem analysis (450+ lines)
- `docs/ADR_001_DATABASE_SYNC_STRATEGY.md` - Architecture Decision Record (431 lines)

#### The Problem 🚨

We will have **two separate database instances**:

```
User's Project Environment          Daemon's Isolated Docker Environment
─────────────────────────           ─────────────────────────────────────
/project/data/                      /daemon-env/data/
  ├── langfuse_traces.db     ≠≠≠      ├── langfuse_traces.db
  ├── notifications.db       ≠≠≠      ├── notifications.db
  └── analytics.db           ≠≠≠      └── analytics.db

CONFLICT: Two separate databases with potentially overlapping/conflicting data!
```

**Specific Issues**:
1. **Notifications**: Daemon writes → Slack bot reads from user's DB (doesn't see it!)
2. **Analytics**: Daemon generates traces → User dashboard reads from user's DB (doesn't see them!)
3. **Roadmap State**: User updates roadmap → Daemon reads from daemon's DB (stale data!)

#### Architecture Options (4 Strategies)

**Option A: Shared SQLite via Docker Volume** ✅ **Recommended for MVP**
- Docker volume mounts user's data directory
- Single source of truth, real-time updates
- ⚠️ SQLite locking issues with concurrent writes
- Simple, good enough for single-developer local use

**Option B: Separate DBs + Unidirectional Sync**
- Daemon writes to isolated DB, periodically syncs to user DB
- Clean isolation, easy cleanup
- ❌ Sync complexity, data lag, storage duplication

**Option C: Network-Accessible PostgreSQL**
- Both connect to shared PostgreSQL instance
- True concurrent access, scales to teams
- ❌ Complex setup, heavier, overkill for local dev

**Option D: Hybrid (Split by Data Type)**
- Shared: analytics, notifications (Docker volume)
- Isolated: daemon internal state (isolated SQLite)
- Best of both worlds but more complex

#### Recommended Phased Approach

**Phase 1: MVP - Shared SQLite** (PRIORITY 1-3)
```yaml
# docker-compose.yml
services:
  daemon:
    volumes:
      - ./data:/project/data:rw  # Share data directory
    environment:
      - ANALYTICS_DB=/project/data/analytics.db
      - NOTIFICATIONS_DB=/project/data/notifications.db
```

**Database Guardrails for MVP**:
1. **WAL Mode**: Enable Write-Ahead Logging for SQLite (`PRAGMA journal_mode=WAL`)
2. **Timeout**: Set busy timeout to 5000ms (`PRAGMA busy_timeout=5000`)
3. **Retry Logic**: Wrap all writes with `@with_retry` decorator
4. **Connection Pooling**: Use SQLAlchemy connection pool (max 5 connections)
5. **Read-Heavy Pattern**: Daemon mostly reads, user mostly writes

**Phase 2: PostgreSQL Migration** (PRIORITY 4+ or later)
- Migrate when scaling to team collaboration or production
- Proper concurrent access with row-level security
- Migration script: SQLite → PostgreSQL

#### Deliverables (Design Phase) ✅ **ALL COMPLETE**

- [x] **Problem Analysis Document** ✅ (`docs/PRIORITY_1.5_DATABASE_SYNC_DESIGN.md`)
- [x] **Architecture Decision Record (ADR)** ✅ (`docs/ADR_001_DATABASE_SYNC_STRATEGY.md`)
- [x] **Data Ownership Matrix** ✅ (in ADR_001 - section "Data Ownership Matrix")
- [x] **Concurrency Strategy** ✅ (in ADR_001 - section "Concurrency Strategy")
- [x] **Implementation Guidelines** ✅ (implemented in PRIORITY 2 & 3: NotificationDB, WAL mode, @with_retry)
- [x] **Testing Strategy** ✅ (in ADR_001 + 27 tests: 11 unit + 16 integration)
- [x] **Migration Plan** ✅ (in ADR_001 - section "Migration Path (Phase 2)")

#### Timeline

**Day 1: Problem Analysis + Requirements** (4-6h)
- Document all use cases (local dev, team, production)
- List all database tables and sync requirements
- Create data ownership matrix (draft)

**Day 2: Architecture Evaluation** (6-8h)
- Prototype architectural options with code
- Test concurrent access scenarios
- Benchmark SQLite vs PostgreSQL performance
- Make recommendation

**Day 3: Decision + Documentation** (4-6h)
- Finalize architecture decision (with approval)
- Write ADR and implementation guidelines
- Document migration path (if phased)
- Review and sign-off

**Total**: 14-20h (2-3 days) - **Design only, implementation in other priorities**

#### Integration with Other Priorities

This is a **design-only priority**. Implementation happens in:
- **PRIORITY 1** (Analytics): Define DB schema with sync strategy
- **PRIORITY 2** (Roadmap CLI): Follow decided database access pattern
- **PRIORITY 3** (Daemon): Follow decided database access pattern
- **All notification priorities**: Use decided sync mechanism

**Reference**: `docs/PRIORITY_1.5_DATABASE_SYNC_DESIGN.md` (comprehensive 450+ line design document)

#### Project: AI-Powered Project Manager CLI (coffee-roadmap)

**Vision**: Create a dedicated **`coffee-roadmap` CLI tool** - an AI-powered project manager that provides an interactive chat interface for managing ROADMAP.md. This is the **ONLY way** to update the roadmap - both user and daemon use it.

#### 📋 Core Operating Principle for project_manager

**CRITICAL BEHAVIOR DIRECTIVE**:

The `project_manager` CLI **MUST** always operate in **PLAN MODE** - a strategic, proactive state:

1. **Always Planning**: Every interaction is a planning session, not just command execution
2. **Strategic Thinking**: Analyze roadmap holistically, identify dependencies, suggest optimizations
3. **Proactive Guidance**: Anticipate blockers, recommend next priorities, highlight risks
4. **Context Awareness**: Understand project state, progress velocity, resource constraints
5. **Decision Support**: Present options with trade-offs, guide user toward optimal choices

**Plan Mode Behavior**:
```
USER INPUT (any command):
  ├─ Analyze current roadmap state
  ├─ Identify related priorities and dependencies
  ├─ Consider project velocity and constraints
  ├─ Execute requested command
  ├─ Provide strategic context and recommendations
  ├─ Suggest next logical steps
  └─ Always leave user with clear action items
```

**Examples of Plan Mode Thinking**:

Instead of:
```
❌ "Notification #5 marked as responded"
```

Do this:
```
✅ "Notification #5 marked as responded

    Impact Analysis:
    - Daemon can now proceed with PRIORITY 3 implementation
    - Estimated completion: 2-3 days
    - Next blocker: Will need approval for dependency upgrades

    Recommendations:
    - Review PRIORITY 4 requirements while daemon works
    - Consider preparing test data for analytics dashboard

    Action Items:
    1. Monitor daemon progress: project-manager status
    2. Plan PRIORITY 4 acceptance criteria
    3. Check back in 24h for next approval request"
```

**Forbidden**: Bare command execution without strategic context
**Required**: Every response includes analysis, impact, and recommendations

This principle ensures project_manager acts as a **strategic PM**, not a simple command executor.

#### 🔄 Continuous Technical Planning Work

**CRITICAL CONTINUOUS OPERATION**:

The `project_manager` **MUST** continuously work on deep technical planning for upcoming priorities:

1. **Always Documenting**: Continuously analyze and document technical implementation details for future priorities
2. **Technical Deep Dives**: For each planned priority without detailed technical specs, research and document:
   - Architecture decisions and trade-offs
   - Implementation patterns and approaches
   - Technology stack requirements
   - API designs and interfaces
   - Database schemas
   - Integration points
   - Testing strategies
   - Deployment considerations

3. **Proactive Research**: Before code_developer starts a priority, ensure complete technical documentation exists
4. **Living Documentation**: Continuously update technical specs as new insights emerge
5. **Risk Analysis**: Document technical risks, blockers, and mitigation strategies

**Continuous Work Pattern**:
```
BACKGROUND PROCESS (always running):
  ├─ Scan ROADMAP for priorities with Status: 📝 Planned
  ├─ Identify priorities lacking technical implementation details
  ├─ Research and document technical architecture
  ├─ Create detailed implementation specs
  ├─ Document API designs, schemas, patterns
  ├─ Identify dependencies and integration points
  ├─ Write technical decision records (ADRs)
  └─ REPEAT for next priority without technical details
```

**Documentation Deliverables for Each Priority**:
- Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)
- API specifications (endpoints, schemas, authentication)
- Database schema designs with migrations
- Component interaction diagrams
- Technology evaluation matrices
- Implementation step-by-step guides
- Testing approach and test cases
- Deployment runbooks
- Performance benchmarks and targets
- Security considerations and threat models

**Example Workflow** (✅ **Real Example: PRIORITY 2 Technical Spec**):
```
PRIORITY 2 Phase 2 Status: 📝 Planned (complex AI integration)
  ↓
project_manager analyzes requirements:
  ├─ Checks ALL prerequisites and dependencies ✅
  │  - anthropic SDK: ✅ installed (0.69.0)
  │  - rich library: ✅ installed (14.1.0)
  │  - ClaudeAPI interface: ✅ exists in autonomous/
  │  - NotificationDB: ✅ exists in cli/
  │
  ├─ Designs complete architecture
  │  - Component diagrams
  │  - Data flow diagrams
  │  - Module structure
  │
  ├─ Documents technical details
  │  - API patterns
  │  - Security considerations
  │  - Performance requirements
  │  - Risk analysis
  │
  └─ Creates implementation plan
     - 3 phases with time estimates
     - Step-by-step breakdown
     - Testing strategy
  ↓
Creates: docs/PRIORITY_2_TECHNICAL_SPEC.md (850+ lines)
  - Complete architecture overview
  - All component specifications with code examples
  - Data flow diagrams
  - Implementation plan (3 phases, 16-22 hours)
  - Testing strategy (unit, integration, E2E)
  - Security & performance requirements
  - Risk analysis with mitigation
  - Clear success criteria
  ↓
PRIORITY 2 now has COMPLETE technical foundation ✅
  ↓
code_developer can implement IMMEDIATELY:
  - No research needed ✅
  - All decisions made ✅
  - Dependencies verified ✅
  - Implementation steps clear ✅
  - Tests planned ✅
```

**Benefit**: When code_developer reaches a priority, **all technical decisions are already made** and documented. The developer can start implementing immediately without research or architectural decisions.

**🚨 MANDATORY RULE**:
- For ANY priority with >1 day effort: Create `docs/PRIORITY_X_TECHNICAL_SPEC.md` FIRST
- Use `docs/PRIORITY_2_TECHNICAL_SPEC.md` as the template
- Verify ALL dependencies are available BEFORE declaring "ready for implementation"
- **NO exceptions** - this prevents wasted effort and ensures quality

**Priority**: This is continuous background work, runs in parallel with user interactions.

#### 🎯 MVP Approach: Start Simple, Scale Smart

**Implementation Strategy**: Build in **two phases** to establish database guardrails first:

**Phase 1: MVP - Basic CLI with Database Guardrails** (2-3 days) ⚡ **START HERE**
- ✅ Shared SQLite via Docker volume (Option A from PRIORITY 1.5)
- ✅ Basic CLI commands (`view`, `status`, `notify`, `sync`)
- ✅ Notification database with proper retry logic
- ✅ WAL mode + timeout configuration
- ✅ `@with_retry` decorator on all writes
- ❌ NO Claude AI yet (too complex for MVP)
- ❌ NO rich terminal UI (basic text is fine)
- ❌ NO roadmap editing (read-only for MVP)

**Phase 2: Full AI Integration** (2-3 days) - After MVP validated
- Add Claude AI for natural language understanding
- Add rich terminal UI with `rich` library
- Add roadmap editing capabilities
- Add Slack integration
- Add history/undo functionality

**Why This Approach?**
1. ✅ **Database guardrails** established early (prevents future sync issues)
2. ✅ **Quick validation** (can test database patterns in 2-3 days)
3. ✅ **Risk mitigation** (complex AI features don't block daemon work)
4. ✅ **Foundation first** (proper patterns before fancy features)

**Reference**: `docs/PROJECT_MANAGER_MVP_DESIGN.md` (comprehensive MVP design with database patterns)

Overall Progress: ██████░░░░░░░░░░░░░░ 25% (2/8 priorities completed)

You: analyze the roadmap health

Claude: 🔍 Roadmap Health Analysis:

📊 Overall Health: 85/100 (Very Good)

Strengths:
✅ Clear priority order with logical dependencies
✅ Realistic time estimates (2-3 weeks per priority)
✅ Good balance of infrastructure vs features (40/60)
✅ All priorities have clear objectives

Concerns:
⚠️  PRIORITY 3 (Autonomous Daemon) is critical path - 60% complete
⚠️  5 priorities waiting on PRIORITY 3 completion
💡 Consider parallelizing PRIORITY 4 & 5 (both Streamlit dashboards)

Recommendations:
1. Focus resources on completing PRIORITY 3 (unblocks 5 priorities)
2. Plan PRIORITY 4 & 5 implementation in parallel (no dependencies)
3. Add time buffers for PRIORITY 8 (new, estimation uncertain)

You: What should we work on next?

Claude: 🎯 Recommendation: **PRIORITY 3 - Autonomous Development Daemon**

Reasoning:
1. **Critical Path**: Blocks 5 downstream priorities
2. **High Impact**: Enables self-implementing system (game-changer)
3. **Already 60% Complete**: Momentum is there, finish it!
4. **Foundation**: Required before daemon can implement PRIORITY 4-8

Next Steps:
1. Complete remaining 40% of PRIORITY 3 (estimated 1-2 days)
2. Run full integration tests
3. Document daemon usage
4. Mark PRIORITY 3 as ✅ COMPLETED
5. Let daemon autonomously implement PRIORITY 4 & 5 in parallel

Estimated completion: 2025-10-11 (2 days from now)

Summary of this session:
• Added 1 new priority (PRIORITY 8)
• Updated 1 status (PRIORITY 3)
• Analyzed roadmap health (85/100)
• All changes synced to daemon environment

Next time: Run `/analyze` to see updated health metrics!
```

**Daemon Integration** (Programmatic API):

```python
from coffee_maker.cli.roadmap_editor import RoadmapEditor

# Daemon uses the same tool programmatically
editor = RoadmapEditor(roadmap_path="docs/ROADMAP.md")

# Update status when daemon completes a task
editor.update_status(
    priority="PRIORITY 3",
    status="🔄 In Progress",
    notes="Implemented overview page and cost charts"
)

# Daemon adds completion details
editor.mark_completed(
    priority="PRIORITY 3",
    completion_date="2025-10-15",
    deliverables=[
        "Multi-page Streamlit dashboard",
        "Interactive Plotly charts",
        "PDF/CSV export functionality"
    ],
    metrics={
        "lines_of_code": 847,
        "files_modified": 12,
        "tests_added": 23
    }
)
```

**Simplified Sync Mechanism** ⚡ **MUCH SIMPLER**:

Instead of complex file watchers and Git-based sync, we now have:

```python
class RoadmapSync:
    """Dead simple sync - just copy the file"""

    def __init__(self, roadmap_path: str, daemon_env_path: str):
        self.roadmap_path = roadmap_path
        self.daemon_env = daemon_env_path

    def sync_to_daemon(self):
        """Copy ROADMAP.md to daemon's isolated environment"""
        shutil.copy(self.roadmap_path, f"{self.daemon_env}/ROADMAP.md")
        logger.info("Synced roadmap to daemon environment")

    def sync_from_daemon(self):
        """Copy daemon's updates back to user roadmap"""
        shutil.copy(f"{self.daemon_env}/ROADMAP.md", self.roadmap_path)
        logger.info("Synced daemon updates to user roadmap")
```

**Benefits of This Approach**:
- ✅ **Single source of truth**: One tool controls all roadmap updates
- ✅ **Zero conflicts**: No concurrent writes (CLI serializes all updates)
- ✅ **Natural language editing**: Use Claude to modify complex roadmap
- ✅ **Daemon simplification**: No need for file watchers or Git sync
- ✅ **User-friendly**: Chat interface instead of manual YAML/Markdown editing
- ✅ **Validation**: CLI validates all changes before applying
- ✅ **Rollback**: CLI maintains history, easy undo
- ✅ **API for daemon**: Daemon uses same logic programmatically

- Completion: (this commit) - PRIORITY 3 marked 100% complete

**Recent Improvements** (2025-10-09):
- ✅ **Critical session conflict fix**: Added runtime detection to prevent daemon from running inside Claude Code sessions
  - Problem: Running daemon from within Claude Code caused hangs due to nested CLI calls
  - Solution: Daemon now detects `CLAUDE_CODE_SESSION` env var and warns user with instructions
  - Impact: Prevents common user error that caused daemon to become unresponsive
- ✅ **Claude CLI non-interactive execution**: Fixed daemon to use `claude -p` flag for non-interactive prompts
  - Problem: Daemon was calling Claude CLI without proper non-interactive flags
  - Solution: Updated to use `claude code -p "prompt"` for programmatic execution
  - Impact: Daemon can now execute Claude CLI reliably without manual intervention
- ✅ **Branch handling improvements**: Fixed Git branch creation and checkout logic
  - Problem: Branch switching sometimes failed in daemon context
  - Solution: Enhanced error handling and branch existence checks
  - Impact: More reliable Git operations during autonomous development

**Critical Usage Requirements** 🚨:
1. **MUST run from separate terminal**: Never run daemon from within Claude Code session
2. **Terminal detection**: Daemon will warn and exit if it detects Claude Code environment
3. **Recommended setup**: Open new terminal window/tab outside Claude Code to run daemon

#### Project: Minimal Self-Implementing AI System with Roadmap-Driven Development

**Vision**: Create a **simple, always-running** Python daemon that continuously reads ROADMAP.md and autonomously implements features via Claude CLI.

**Core Philosophy**: **Keep it minimal and focused** - just enough to autonomously implement features. Advanced features (monitoring, isolated environments) come later.

#### 🤖 Core Operating Principle for code_developer

**CRITICAL BEHAVIOR DIRECTIVE**:

The `code_developer` daemon **MUST** operate with complete autonomy and relentless execution:

1. **Always Resume Work**: On every session start, immediately resume work or progress on `docs/ROADMAP.md`
2. **Never Ask Permission**: The daemon is authorized to do **anything** during current and all future sessions
3. **Continuous Execution**: Keep working on `docs/ROADMAP.md` without self-interruption until **all roadmap items are implemented**
4. **No Human Intervention Required**: Do not pause for approval, confirmation, or user input unless explicitly required by a blocking decision
5. **Relentless Progress**: If blocked, document the blocker and move to the next implementable priority
6. **Self-Directed**: The daemon decides implementation details, approaches, and execution order within each priority

**Session Behavior**:
```
START SESSION:
  ├─ Read docs/ROADMAP.md
  ├─ Find next planned/in-progress priority
  ├─ Implement it completely (code + tests + docs)
  ├─ Update ROADMAP.md status
  ├─ Commit + Push + Create PR
  ├─ Move to next priority
  └─ REPEAT until roadmap.status == "✅ ALL COMPLETE"
```

**Forbidden Actions**:
- ❌ Asking "Should I implement X?" → Just implement it
- ❌ Waiting for approval to update dependencies → Update them
- ❌ Stopping mid-implementation → Complete the full priority
- ❌ Leaving TODOs for later → Implement everything now

**Authorized Actions** (No Permission Needed):
- ✅ Write any code in `coffee_maker/`
- ✅ Add/modify tests in `tests/`
- ✅ Update documentation in `docs/`
- ✅ Install/upgrade dependencies in `pyproject.toml`
- ✅ Create branches, commits, PRs
- ✅ Run tests, linters, formatters
- ✅ Update ROADMAP.md status

**Default Response to Uncertainty**: **ACT**, don't ask. Make the best decision and implement it. Document choices in commit messages.

This principle ensures the daemon operates as a **truly autonomous developer**, not an interactive assistant.

#### 🎯 CRITICAL: Understanding PRIORITIES vs PROJECTS

**⚠️ IMPORTANT DISTINCTION FOR code_developer**:

**PRIORITIES** are **strategic phases/milestones** - they are NOT code to implement!
- Example: "PRIORITY 1: Analytics & Observability"
- This is a strategic grouping, not a specific implementation

**PROJECTS** are **actual implementations** - these are what you should code!
- Example: "Project: Langfuse → SQLite Export & Analysis"
- Example: "Project: Multi-Model Code Review Agent"
- These are concrete features with code, tests, and documentation

**DO NOT** try to "implement PRIORITY X" - priorities are already organizational structure!

**DO** implement the **PROJECTS** listed within priorities or in the unimplemented projects list below.

#### 📋 Unimplemented Projects Work Queue (code_developer START HERE)

**CRITICAL**: This is your work queue. Pick the next unimplemented project and build it.

##### ✅ Already Implemented (DO NOT re-implement)
- ✅ **Analytics & Observability** (PRIORITY 1)
  - ✅ Langfuse → SQLite Export & Analysis
  - ✅ SQLite analytics schema
  - ✅ Query analysis tools

- ✅ **Roadmap Management CLI** (PRIORITY 2 - MVP Phase 1)
  - ✅ project-manager binary (basic commands)
  - ✅ NotificationDB for daemon communication
  - ✅ Basic CLI commands (view, notifications, respond)

- ✅ **Autonomous Development Daemon** (PRIORITY 3 - 90%)
  - ✅ DevDaemon core loop
  - ✅ RoadmapParser
  - ✅ ClaudeCLIInterface
  - ✅ GitManager
  - ✅ Session conflict detection
  - ⏳ E2E testing (10% remaining)

- ✅ **Multi-Model Code Review Agent** (PRIORITY 6 - Option A)
  - ✅ ~2,345 lines implemented but not committed
  - ✅ 4 perspectives (Bug Hunter, Architect, Performance, Security)
  - ✅ Pattern-based analysis
  - ✅ HTML/Markdown/JSON reports
  - ✅ Git hooks integration
  - ⚠️ **ACTION NEEDED**: Commit this code and add tests

##### 🚀 Next Projects to Implement (PICK ONE AND START)

**🔴 TOP PRIORITY - MUST IMPLEMENT FIRST** (Replaces Claude CLI as primary interface):

1. **🤖 AI-Powered Project Manager CLI - Phase 2** (PRIORITY 2 - 20% remaining) ⚡ **CRITICAL**
   - **Goal**: Make project-manager the ONLY interface needed (replace Claude CLI)
   - **Location**: Enhance `coffee_maker/cli/roadmap_cli.py`
   - **Current Status**: Phase 1 MVP complete (basic commands work)
   - **Phase 2 Features to Implement**:

     **Core AI Integration**:

     **Natural Language Examples**:
     ```
     You: "add a priority for CSV export feature"
     PM: "I'll add PRIORITY 9: CSV Data Export. Should it be high priority?"

     You: "yes, make it high priority and estimate 2 days"
     PM: "✅ Added PRIORITY 9 (High, 2 days). Updated roadmap."

     You: "what should I work on next?"
     PM: "Based on dependencies, I recommend PRIORITY 3 (Analytics Dashboard).
          It unblocks 2 other priorities and has high business value."

     You: "implement PRIORITY 3"
     PM: "Starting code-developer daemon for PRIORITY 3...
          I'll notify you when it needs approval or completes."
     ```

     **Rich Terminal UI**:
     - [ ] Colored output with `rich` library
     - [ ] Progress bars for roadmap completion

     - [ ] `stop-daemon` command
     - [ ] Real-time daemon status display
     - [ ] Notification relay (daemon → user)
     - [ ] Response forwarding (user → daemon)
     - [ ] **Continuous Background Monitoring** (critical requirement):
       - Monitor daemon status every 5-10 seconds in background thread
       - Detect if daemon stops unexpectedly (crashes, hangs)
       - Alert user if daemon is inactive for >30 seconds
       - Show daemon health in status bar
       - Track daemon heartbeat (last activity timestamp)
       - Notify user of significant daemon events (started task, finished task, blocked)
       - Auto-restart daemon if configured (optional safety feature)

     **Intelligence Features**:
     - [ ] Roadmap health scoring algorithm
     - [ ] Dependency analysis (what blocks what)
     - [ ] Timeline estimation (velocity-based)
     - [ ] Smart recommendations (what to work on next)
     - [ ] Auto-validation (status transitions, estimates)

   - **Dependencies**:
     - Anthropic Python SDK (`anthropic>=0.8.0`)
     - Rich library (`rich>=13.0.0`)
     - Existing NotificationDB (already implemented)

   - **Success Criteria**:
     - ✅ User can chat with project-manager in natural language
     - ✅ project-manager can add/update roadmap via AI
     - ✅ project-manager can start/stop code-developer daemon

   - **Key Implementation Details**:
     - Interactive REPL loop (like Claude CLI)
     - Streaming responses with `rich` library
     - Claude API integration (Anthropic SDK)
     - Command parsing (`/add`, `/update`, `/implement`, `/status`, `/exit`)
     - Natural language understanding (Claude parses user intent)
     - Maintains conversation context
     - Can start/stop code-developer daemon
     - Shows real-time daemon status
     - Beautiful formatting with colors and boxes

   - **Success Criteria**:
     - ✅ Looks and feels like Claude CLI (interactive chat)
     - ✅ Understands natural language via Claude API
     - ✅ Can manage roadmap (add, update, view)
     - ✅ Can control code-developer daemon (start/stop/status)
     - ✅ **Continuously monitors code-developer in background thread**
     - ✅ Alerts user if daemon stops/crashes/hangs
     - ✅ Shows real-time daemon status in status bar
     - ✅ Beautiful terminal UI with colors
     - ✅ User never needs Claude CLI anymore

   - **Estimated**: 2-3 days
   - **Status**: 📝 **START THIS NOW** - It's #1 in the work queue above

**AFTER project-manager Phase 2 is complete**:
2. **Commit Code Review Agent** (already implemented, just needs commit/tests)
3. **Then pick**: Streamlit Analytics Dashboard OR Self-Improving Prompt Lab

**DO NOT**:
- ❌ Try to "implement PRIORITY 1" (already done!)
- ❌ Try to "implement PRIORITY 2" (it's a milestone, not a project)
- ❌ Skip the AI-Powered PM CLI - it's THE priority
- ❌ Re-implement existing projects
- ❌ Ask which one to do - the order is clear above!

**Simplified Architecture** (thanks to PRIORITY 2):
- ✅ **No file watchers needed**: Daemon reads ROADMAP.md from its environment
- ✅ **No Git sync needed**: Uses `coffee-roadmap` API for status updates
- ✅ **No conflict resolution**: `coffee-roadmap` CLI handles all updates

**Two-Tier Architecture**:
1. **User → `coffee-roadmap` CLI**: User plans roadmap via interactive chat
2. **Daemon → `coffee-roadmap` API**: Daemon updates status programmatically

**Objectives**:
- Create a **minimal** Python daemon that supervises Claude Code CLI execution
- Enable Claude to read ROADMAP.md and autonomously implement features
- Automatic branch creation, implementation, PR creation, and progress tracking
- Simple Git-based safety with rollback capabilities
- **Daemon runs continuously** without stopping until all roadmap priorities are completed

**Key Features** (minimal set):
- 🤖 **Autonomous Implementation**: Claude reads roadmap and implements features
- 🔁 **Continuous Loop**: Daemon never stops, always looking for next task
- 🌳 **Basic Git Automation**: Auto-creates branches, commits, pushes, creates PRs
- 📊 **Simple Progress Tracking**: Updates ROADMAP.md with completion status
- 🔧 **CLI Integration**: Python subprocess wrapper for Claude CLI
- 🛡️ **Basic Safety**: Git-based versioning, all changes reversible
- 📝 **Self-Documentation**: Claude documents its own work in the roadmap

**Minimal Architecture** (keep it simple):
```
coffee_maker/autonomous/
├── __init__.py
├── daemon.py                      # Main daemon (single file, ~300-500 LOC)
├── roadmap_parser.py              # Parses ROADMAP.md for tasks
├── claude_cli_interface.py        # Subprocess wrapper for Claude CLI
├── git_manager.py                 # Basic Git operations (branch, commit, PR)

scripts/
└── run_dev_daemon.py              # Daemon launcher (infinite loop)
```

**Deliverables** (minimal set):
- [ ] **RoadmapParser**: Extract tasks/priorities from ROADMAP.md (simple regex/markdown parsing)
- [ ] **ClaudeCLIInterface**: Basic subprocess wrapper for Claude CLI
- [ ] **GitManager**: Create branches, commit, push, create PRs via gh CLI
- [ ] **ProgressTracker**: Uses `coffee-roadmap` API to update status ⚡ SIMPLIFIED
- [ ] **DevDaemon**: Main loop that continuously reads roadmap and executes next task
- [ ] **Basic error handling**: Retry logic and simple logging
- [ ] **Setup documentation**: Quick start guide

**Example Workflow**:
```python
# User updates ROADMAP.md with new priority
# Then starts the daemon:

from coffee_maker.autonomous.daemon import DevDaemon

# Initialize autonomous development daemon
daemon = DevDaemon(
    roadmap_path="docs/ROADMAP.md",
    auto_approve=True,
    create_prs=True,
    model="claude-sonnet-4"
)

# Daemon reads ROADMAP.md and finds:
# "PRIORITY 2: Analytics & Observability - Status: 📝 Planned"

# Autonomous execution:
# 1. Creates branch: feature/analytics-export-langfuse
# 2. Prompts Claude: "Read docs/ROADMAP.md, implement PRIORITY 2"
# 3. Claude implements feature following roadmap guidelines
# 4. Claude commits with proper messages (following Git guidelines)
# 5. Runs tests automatically
# 6. Updates ROADMAP.md: Status: ✅ COMPLETED
# 7. Pushes branch and creates PR
# 8. Notifies user: "PRIORITY 2 completed, PR #123 ready for review"

# User reviews PR, merges if satisfied
# Daemon automatically moves to PRIORITY 3
```

**Interactive Messaging System** ⚡ NEW:

The daemon includes an intelligent message handler that intercepts Claude CLI's questions and can either:
1. **Auto-respond** based on predefined rules and roadmap context
2. **Notify user** for critical decisions requiring human judgment

```python
from coffee_maker.autonomous.claude_cli import MessageHandler

# Message handler configuration
handler = MessageHandler(
    auto_respond_rules={
        # Questions the daemon can answer automatically
        "continue?": lambda ctx: "yes" if ctx.tests_passed else "no",
        "commit now?": lambda ctx: "yes" if ctx.changes_valid else "no",
        "run tests?": lambda ctx: "yes",  # Always run tests
        "create PR?": lambda ctx: "yes" if ctx.branch_ready else "no",
    },
    notify_user_patterns=[
        # Questions that require user input
        r"API key",
        r"credentials",
        r"delete.*production",
        r"breaking change",
        r"merge to main",
    ],
    log_all_interactions=True,  # Log everything for traceability
    interaction_log_dir="coffee_maker/autonomous/interaction_logs/"
)

# Example interaction flow:
# 1. Claude asks: "Tests passed. Should I commit these changes?"
# 2. MessageHandler intercepts the question
# 3. Checks auto_respond_rules → matches "commit now?"
# 4. Evaluates lambda: ctx.changes_valid is True
# 5. Automatically responds: "yes"
# 6. Logs interaction to interaction_logs/2025-10-09_14-23-45.json

# For questions requiring user input:
# 1. Claude asks: "I found API key in .env. Should I commit it?"
# 2. MessageHandler detects pattern "API key" in notify_user_patterns
# 3. Logs the question
# 4. Pauses execution
# 5. Sends notification to user: "⚠️ Claude needs input: [question]"
# 6. Waits for user response
# 7. Forwards response to Claude
# 8. Logs the complete exchange
# 9. Resumes execution
```

**Interaction Logging**:

All Claude ↔ Python exchanges are logged with full context:

```json
{
  "timestamp": "2025-10-09T14:23:45Z",
  "priority": "PRIORITY 2: Analytics & Observability",
  "phase": "implementation",
  "interaction_type": "auto_response",
  "question_from_claude": "Tests passed. Should I commit these changes?",
  "context": {
    "tests_passed": true,
    "changes_valid": true,
    "files_modified": ["coffee_maker/analytics/exporter.py"],
    "branch": "feature/analytics-export-langfuse"
  },
  "response_from_python": "yes",
  "response_method": "auto_respond_rule: commit now?",
  "user_notified": false
}
```

**Benefits of Interactive Messaging**:
- ✅ **Full traceability**: Every interaction logged with context
- ✅ **Intelligent automation**: Python answers routine questions automatically
- ✅ **Human-in-the-loop**: Critical decisions escalated to user
- ✅ **Debugging**: Complete audit trail of all Claude ↔ Python exchanges
- ✅ **Safety**: Prevents dangerous actions without explicit approval
- ✅ **Transparency**: User can review all interactions post-execution

---

**User Notification & Input Handling System** ⚡ NEW:

The daemon includes a **two-way (bidirectional) messaging system** that both alerts users and collects their input when needed. The underlying notification object is capable of both sending messages to users and receiving responses back, enabling true interactive communication between the autonomous daemon and the user.

**Notification Channels**:

1. **Terminal/CLI** (default, always enabled):
   ```
   ╔════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╗
   ║ 🤖 CLAUDE CLI - USER INPUT REQUIRED                       ║

   ║                                                            ║
   ║ Options: [yes/no/skip]                                    ║
   ║ Timeout: 5 minutes                                        ║
   ╚════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╝
   Your answer: _
   ```

2. **Desktop Notifications** (macOS, Linux, Windows):
   - Uses native notification APIs
   - Click notification to open input prompt
   - Configurable sound/priority

3. **Webhooks** (Slack, Discord, Teams, etc.):
   - POST notification to configured webhook URL
   - Supports interactive buttons (Slack/Discord)
   - Reply via webhook or terminal

4. **Email** (optional, for long-running tasks):
   - Send email with question
   - Reply to email or via web link
   - Useful for overnight/weekend executions

**Configuration Example**:

```python
from coffee_maker.autonomous.notifications import Notifier, InputHandler

# Configure notification channels
notifier = Notifier(
    channels={
        "terminal": {"enabled": True, "priority": "high"},
        "desktop": {
            "enabled": True,
            "platforms": ["macos", "linux"],  # Auto-detect platform
            "sound": True,
            "urgency": "critical"
        },
        "webhook": {
            "enabled": True,
            "url": "https://hooks.slack.com/services/YOUR/WEBHOOK/URL",
            "type": "slack",  # or "discord", "teams", "generic"
            "mention_user": "@developer"  # Slack/Discord mention
        },
        "email": {
            "enabled": False,  # Optional
            "smtp_server": "smtp.gmail.com",
            "to": "developer@example.com",
            "from": "claude-daemon@example.com"
        }
    },
    fallback_order=["terminal", "desktop", "webhook", "email"]
)

# Configure input handler
input_handler = InputHandler(
    timeout=300,  # 5 minutes default
    validation_rules={
        "yes/no": lambda x: x.lower() in ["yes", "no", "y", "n"],
        "continue": lambda x: x.lower() in ["continue", "stop", "skip"],
    },
    retry_on_invalid=True,
    max_retries=3
)
```

**End-to-End Flow with Notifications**:

```python
# 1. Claude encounters a question requiring user input
claude_question = "I found API key in .env. Should I commit it?"

# 2. MessageHandler detects it needs user input
if message_handler.requires_user_input(claude_question):

    # 3. Create notification
    notification = {
        "title": "🤖 Claude CLI - Input Required",
        "priority": "PRIORITY 2: Analytics & Observability",
        "phase": "implementation",
        "question": claude_question,
        "options": ["yes", "no", "skip"],
        "timeout": 300,  # 5 minutes
        "context": {
            "file": ".env",
            "branch": "feature/analytics-export-langfuse",
            "severity": "critical"
        }
    }

    # 4. Send notifications via all enabled channels
    notifier.send(notification)
    # → Terminal: Rich formatted prompt
    # → Desktop: Native notification
    # → Slack: Interactive message with buttons

    # 5. Wait for user input (blocking or async)
    user_response = input_handler.wait_for_input(
        notification_id=notification["id"],
        timeout=300,
        validation="yes/no"
    )

    # 6. Handle response
    if user_response.timed_out:
        # Use default safe action
        response = "no"  # Don't commit sensitive data by default
        notifier.send_timeout_alert(notification)
    elif user_response.valid:
        response = user_response.value
    else:
        response = "skip"  # Invalid input

    # 7. Log the interaction
    interaction_logger.log({
        "question": claude_question,
        "notification_sent_to": ["terminal", "desktop", "slack"],
        "user_response": response,
        "response_time_seconds": user_response.elapsed_time,
        "timed_out": user_response.timed_out
    })

    # 8. Forward response to Claude
    message_handler.respond_to_claude(response)
```

**Notification Queue Management**:

For multiple concurrent questions:

```python
# Queue manages multiple pending notifications
queue = NotificationQueue()

# Add notifications
queue.add(notification1, priority="high")
queue.add(notification2, priority="medium")
queue.add(notification3, priority="low")

# Process in priority order
while not queue.empty():
    notification = queue.get_next()
    user_response = input_handler.wait_for_input(notification)
    queue.mark_complete(notification.id, user_response)
```

**Unified Slack Integration** ⚡ NEW - Dual Interface:

Slack notifications can interact with **BOTH** the daemon and the project manager CLI:

```python
# Slack receives interactive message with dual routing:
{
  "text": "🤖 *Coffee Maker - Input Required*",
  "blocks": [
    {
      "type": "section",
      "text": {
        "type": "mrkdwn",
        "text": "*From:* Autonomous Daemon\n*Priority:* PRIORITY 2 - Analytics & Observability\n*Phase:* Implementation"
      }
    },
    {
      "type": "section",
      "text": {
        "type": "mrkdwn",
        "text": "*Question from Claude:*\nI found an API key in .env file. Should I commit it?"
      }
    },
    {
      "type": "actions",
      "elements": [
        {"type": "button", "text": {"type": "plain_text", "text": "✅ Yes"}, "value": "daemon:yes"},
        {"type": "button", "text": {"type": "plain_text", "text": "❌ No"}, "value": "daemon:no"},
        {"type": "button", "text": {"type": "plain_text", "text": "⏭️ Skip"}, "value": "daemon:skip"}
      ]
    },
    {
      "type": "divider"
    },
    {
      "type": "section",
      "text": {
        "type": "mrkdwn",
        "text": "💬 *Or interact with Project Manager:*"
      }
    },
    {
      "type": "actions",
      "elements": [
        {"type": "button", "text": {"type": "plain_text", "text": "📝 Update Roadmap"}, "value": "pm:/update"},
        {"type": "button", "text": {"type": "plain_text", "text": "📊 View Status"}, "value": "pm:/view"},
        {"type": "button", "text": {"type": "plain_text", "text": "📈 Show Metrics"}, "value": "pm:/metrics"}
      ]
    }
  ]
}

# User interaction routing:
# 1. Click "No" button → Routes to daemon: daemon.respond("no")
# 2. Click "Update Roadmap" → Routes to PM: coffee_roadmap.execute("/update PRIORITY 2 status in-progress")
# 3. Type message in thread → Routes to PM chat: coffee_roadmap.chat("Add priority for...")
```

**Dual-Routing Architecture**:

```python
from coffee_maker.notifications import UnifiedNotificationHub

# Unified notification hub routes messages to daemon OR project manager
hub = UnifiedNotificationHub(
    daemon=daemon,
    project_manager=coffee_roadmap_cli,
    notification_db="data/notifications.db"  # Store all notifications
)

# Slack webhook receives user action
@app.route("/slack/actions", methods=["POST"])
def slack_actions():
    payload = request.json
    action_value = payload["actions"][0]["value"]

    # Route based on prefix
    if action_value.startswith("daemon:"):
        # Route to daemon
        response = action_value.split(":", 1)[1]  # "yes", "no", "skip"
        hub.route_to_daemon(response)

    elif action_value.startswith("pm:"):
        # Route to project manager CLI
        command = action_value.split(":", 1)[1]  # "/update", "/view", etc.
        result = hub.route_to_project_manager(command)

        # Post result back to Slack
        return jsonify({
            "text": f"✅ Project Manager: {result}"
        })

# User can also chat directly in Slack thread
@app.route("/slack/events", methods=["POST"])
def slack_events():
    event = request.json["event"]

    if event["type"] == "message":
        user_message = event["text"]

        # Determine routing (daemon vs PM)
        if "roadmap" in user_message.lower() or any(cmd in user_message for cmd in ["/add", "/update", "/view"]):
            # Route to project manager
            response = hub.route_to_project_manager(user_message)
        else:
            # Route to daemon
            response = hub.route_to_daemon(user_message)

        # Post AI response to Slack
        post_to_slack(event["channel"], response)
```

**Notification Database Schema** ⚡ NEW:

```

**Langfuse Integration Example**:

```python
from langfuse import Langfuse
from coffee_maker.autonomous.notifications import Notifier

# All daemon operations traced in Langfuse
langfuse = Langfuse()

# Main trace for autonomous implementation session
trace = langfuse.trace(
    name="autonomous-implementation",
    metadata={
        "priority": "PRIORITY 2: Analytics & Observability",
        "branch": "feature/analytics-export-langfuse"
    }
)

# Span for user notification
notification_span = trace.span(
    name="user-notification-required",
    input={
        "question": "Found API key in .env. Commit it?",
        "channels": ["terminal", "desktop", "slack"],
        "timeout": 300
    }
)

# Log user response
notification_span.end(
    output={
        "user_response": "no",
        "response_time_seconds": 45.2,
        "channel_used": "slack",
        "timed_out": False
    }
)
```

**Structured Logging**:

```python
import structlog

logger = structlog.get_logger()

# Log notification sent
logger.info(
    "notification_sent",
    notification_id="notif-001",
    question_type="security_check",
    channels=["terminal", "desktop", "slack"],
    severity="critical"
)

# Log user response
logger.info(
    "user_response_received",
    notification_id="notif-001",
    response="no",
    response_time_ms=45200,
    channel="slack",
    valid=True
)
```

**Metrics Tracked**:
- Notifications sent per hour/day
- Average user response time per channel
- Timeout rate by question type
- Most common questions requiring user input
- Channel effectiveness (response rate)
- Daemon blocking time waiting for user

**Benefits of Observability**:
- ✅ **Full traceability**: Every notification in Langfuse
- ✅ **Performance insights**: Identify slow response patterns
- ✅ **Trend analysis**: Track autonomous vs manual decisions
- ✅ **Debugging**: Correlate notifications with Claude actions
- ✅ **Cost tracking**: Monitor LLM usage during autonomous execution

**Safety Guarantees**:
- ✅ **All changes in Git**: Complete version history, easy rollback
- ✅ **Follows roadmap guidelines**: Git conventions, commit messages, tests
- ✅ **PR-based workflow**: Human review before merging to main
- ✅ **Test validation**: Auto-runs tests, blocks commits on failures
- ✅ **Branch isolation**: Each priority in separate branch
- ✅ **Progress transparency**: All changes documented in ROADMAP.md

**Benefits**:
- 🚀 **Accelerated development**: Claude implements while you plan
- 🤖 **Self-improving system**: Framework builds itself
- 📊 **Full traceability**: Every change documented and versioned
- 🎯 **Roadmap-driven**: Ensures alignment with project vision
- 💰 **Cost-effective**: Automation of repetitive implementation tasks
- 🧪 **Quality assured**: Tests run automatically before commits
- 🔄 **Continuous delivery**: Features implemented as soon as planned

**Real-Time ROADMAP.md Update Mechanism** ⚡ NEW:

The daemon needs to **safely update** the user's ROADMAP.md while avoiding conflicts. Here's the robust architecture:

**Challenge**: Both user and daemon modify ROADMAP.md simultaneously
- User adds new priorities, updates requirements
- Daemon updates task statuses, adds completion notes

**Solution: File Watcher + Git-Based Conflict Resolution**

```python
from coffee_maker.autonomous.roadmap import RoadmapSync

# Real-time bidirectional sync
sync = RoadmapSync(
    roadmap_path="docs/ROADMAP.md",
    sync_strategy="git-based",  # or "file-lock", "event-driven"
    conflict_resolution="user-wins",  # User changes always take precedence
    update_interval=5,  # Check for changes every 5 seconds
)

# Daemon workflow:
# 1. Daemon reads ROADMAP.md
# 2. Daemon implements feature
# 3. Before updating ROADMAP.md, daemon checks for user changes
# 4. If user modified ROADMAP.md → merge changes intelligently
# 5. Daemon updates only its designated sections (Status, Progress)
# 6. User modifications preserved (Requirements, Objectives)
```

**Architecture Options**:

### **Option 1: Git-Based Sync** ✅ **RECOMMENDED**

Use Git as the single source of truth:

```python
class GitBasedRoadmapSync:
    """Git-based real-time ROADMAP.md synchronization"""

    def __init__(self, roadmap_path: str):
        self.roadmap_path = roadmap_path
        self.daemon_branch = "daemon/roadmap-updates"
        self.user_branch = "main"

    def update_roadmap(self, updates: Dict[str, str]):
        """Safely update ROADMAP.md with daemon progress"""

        # 1. Fetch latest changes from user
        subprocess.run(["git", "fetch", "origin", self.user_branch])

        # 2. Check if user modified ROADMAP.md since last read
        result = subprocess.run(
            ["git", "diff", "HEAD", f"origin/{self.user_branch}", "--", self.roadmap_path],
            capture_output=True
        )

        if result.stdout:  # User made changes
            # 3. Pull user changes first
            subprocess.run(["git", "pull", "origin", self.user_branch])

            # 4. Re-read roadmap with user updates
            roadmap = self._read_roadmap()

        # 5. Apply daemon updates to specific sections only
        updated_roadmap = self._apply_daemon_updates(roadmap, updates)

        # 6. Write updated roadmap
        self._write_roadmap(updated_roadmap)

        # 7. Commit daemon changes
        subprocess.run(["git", "add", self.roadmap_path])
        subprocess.run([
            "git", "commit", "-m",
            f"chore(roadmap): update progress - {updates['priority']}"
        ])

        # 8. Push to remote
        subprocess.run(["git", "push", "origin", self.daemon_branch])

        # 9. Create PR for user review (optional, auto-merge if safe)
        if self._is_safe_to_merge():
            subprocess.run(["git", "merge", self.daemon_branch])
        else:
            self._create_pr_for_review()
```

**Benefits**:
- ✅ Git tracks all changes (full audit trail)
- ✅ User can review daemon updates via PRs
- ✅ Easy rollback if daemon makes mistakes
- ✅ Works with existing Git workflow

### **Option 2: File Lock with Retry** (Simpler, less robust)

```python
import fcntl
import time

class FileLockRoadmapSync:
    """File lock-based synchronization (simpler but less robust)"""

    def update_roadmap(self, updates: Dict[str, str]):
        """Update ROADMAP.md with file locking"""

        max_retries = 5
        for attempt in range(max_retries):
            try:
                # 1. Acquire exclusive lock
                with open(self.roadmap_path, "r+") as f:
                    fcntl.flock(f.fileno(), fcntl.LOCK_EX | fcntl.LOCK_NB)

                    # 2. Read current roadmap
                    content = f.read()

                    # 3. Apply updates
                    updated_content = self._apply_updates(content, updates)

                    # 4. Write back
                    f.seek(0)
                    f.write(updated_content)
                    f.truncate()

                    # 5. Release lock (automatic on close)
                    fcntl.flock(f.fileno(), fcntl.LOCK_UN)

                    logger.info("Roadmap updated successfully")
                    return

            except BlockingIOError:
                # User is currently editing the file
                logger.warning(f"Roadmap locked, retry {attempt + 1}/{max_retries}")
                time.sleep(2 ** attempt)  # Exponential backoff

        logger.error("Failed to acquire roadmap lock after retries")
```

**Benefits**:
- ✅ Simple implementation
- ✅ Prevents concurrent writes
- ❌ No version history
- ❌ Can't detect user changes after daemon reads

### **Option 3: Event-Driven with File Watcher** ⚡ **BEST FOR REAL-TIME**

```python
from watchdog.observers import Observer
from watchdog.events import FileSystemEventHandler

class RoadmapWatcher(FileSystemEventHandler):
    """Watch for user changes to ROADMAP.md in real-time"""

    def __init__(self, daemon):
        self.daemon = daemon
        self.last_modified_by = None

    def on_modified(self, event):
        if event.src_path.endswith("ROADMAP.md"):
            # 1. Check who modified (user or daemon)
            if self.last_modified_by == "daemon":
                # Daemon just updated, ignore
                self.last_modified_by = None
                return

            # 2. User modified the roadmap
            logger.info("User modified ROADMAP.md, reloading tasks")

            # 3. Re-parse roadmap for new tasks
            new_tasks = self.daemon.roadmap_parser.parse()

            # 4. Update daemon's task queue
            self.daemon.task_queue.update(new_tasks)

            # 5. Notify daemon of changes
            self.daemon.on_roadmap_updated(new_tasks)

# Usage:
observer = Observer()
observer.schedule(RoadmapWatcher(daemon), path="docs/", recursive=False)
observer.start()

# Daemon updates roadmap:
def update_roadmap_status(priority: str, status: str):
    watcher.last_modified_by = "daemon"  # Mark as daemon update

    # Apply update
    roadmap = read_roadmap()
    roadmap = update_status(roadmap, priority, status)
    write_roadmap(roadmap)

    # Watcher will ignore this change (last_modified_by = "daemon")
```

**Benefits**:
- ✅ **True real-time** updates (< 1 second latency)
- ✅ Daemon instantly aware of user changes
- ✅ User sees daemon progress updates immediately
- ✅ Works with any editor (VS Code, vim, etc.)

### **Option 4: Section-Based Locking** (Most Precise)

```python
class SectionBasedRoadmapSync:
    """Update only specific sections, avoid conflicts"""

    DAEMON_SECTIONS = [
        "## 📋 Project Status",
        "### 🔄 In Progress",
        "### ✅ Completed Projects"
    ]

    USER_SECTIONS = [
        "## 🚀 Prioritized Roadmap",
        "**Objectives**:",
        "**Key Features**:"
    ]

    def update_roadmap(self, section: str, updates: str):
        """Update only daemon-owned sections"""

        if section not in self.DAEMON_SECTIONS:
            raise ValueError(f"Daemon cannot modify {section}")

        # 1. Read roadmap
        roadmap = self._read_roadmap()

        # 2. Parse into sections
        sections = self._parse_sections(roadmap)

        # 3. Update only daemon section
        sections[section] = updates

        # 4. Preserve user sections unchanged
        for user_section in self.USER_SECTIONS:
            # Don't touch user sections
            pass

        # 5. Reconstruct roadmap
        updated_roadmap = self._reconstruct_roadmap(sections)

        # 6. Write back
        self._write_roadmap(updated_roadmap)
```

**Example Section Ownership**:

```markdown
## 📋 Project Status  ← DAEMON OWNS (can update status)

### ✅ Completed Projects
**Status**: ✅ COMPLETED  ← Daemon updates this
**Completion Date**: 2025-10-10  ← Daemon updates this

## 🚀 Prioritized Roadmap  ← USER OWNS (daemon read-only)

### 🔴 PRIORITY 2: Analytics
**Objectives**:  ← User defines this
- Export Langfuse traces  ← User defines this
**Status**: 🔄 In Progress  ← Daemon updates this
```

**Benefits**:
- ✅ Clear ownership boundaries
- ✅ Zero conflicts (daemon/user edit different sections)
- ✅ User can update requirements while daemon works
- ✅ Daemon can update status while user plans

### **Recommended Implementation: Hybrid Approach** ⚡

Combine the best of all approaches:

```python
class HybridRoadmapSync:
    """Best of all worlds: Git + File Watcher + Section Locking"""

    def __init__(self):
        self.git_sync = GitBasedRoadmapSync()
        self.file_watcher = RoadmapWatcher(self)
        self.section_lock = SectionBasedRoadmapSync()

    def start(self):
        # 1. Start file watcher for real-time user changes
        self.file_watcher.start()

        # 2. Use Git for daemon updates (audit trail)
        # 3. Use section locking to prevent conflicts

    def update_progress(self, priority: str, status: str, notes: str):
        """Daemon updates progress safely"""

        # 1. Check for user changes (via file watcher)
        if self.file_watcher.user_modified:
            # 2. Pull latest user changes from Git
            self.git_sync.pull_user_changes()

        # 3. Update only daemon-owned section
        updates = {
            "section": "### 🔄 In Progress",
            "priority": priority,
            "status": status,
            "notes": notes,
            "timestamp": datetime.now().isoformat()
        }

        # 4. Apply section-locked update
        self.section_lock.update_roadmap(updates["section"], updates)

        # 5. Commit to Git for audit trail
        self.git_sync.commit_daemon_update(updates)

        # 6. Mark as daemon update (file watcher ignores)
        self.file_watcher.last_modified_by = "daemon"
```

**Complete Flow Example**:

```
User Action                          Daemon Action
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
User opens ROADMAP.md
User adds new PRIORITY 8
User saves file                      → File watcher detects change
                                     → Daemon reloads roadmap
                                     → Daemon adds PRIORITY 8 to queue
                                     → Daemon starts PRIORITY 8

User continues editing               → Daemon implements feature
User updates PRIORITY 9 objectives   → Daemon runs tests
User saves file                      → File watcher detects change
                                     → Daemon reloads (sees PRIORITY 9 update)

                                     → Daemon completes PRIORITY 8
                                     → Daemon updates "In Progress" section
                                     → File watcher marks as daemon update
User sees status change ← ────────── → Daemon saves ROADMAP.md
User reviews daemon update           → Daemon commits to Git
User merges daemon PR                → Daemon moves to PRIORITY 9
```

**Claude CLI Agent Integration with Two-Way Messaging System** ⚡ NEW:

The Claude CLI agent leverages the two-way messaging system (described above) to interact with the project manager when it needs input or wants to report important milestones.

**Use Cases**:

1. **Questions Requiring Project Manager Input**:
   - "I found an API key in .env. Should I commit it?" (security decision)
   - "Test XYZ is failing. Should I fix it or skip it?" (scope decision)
   - "I found duplicate code. Should I refactor now or defer?" (priority decision)
   - "Should I use library X or Y for this feature?" (architecture decision)
   - "The current branch is behind main by 5 commits. Should I rebase?" (git workflow decision)

2. **Important Milestone Notifications**:
   - "✅ PRIORITY 2 implementation complete - 112/112 tests passing"
   - "📝 Pull request #123 created and ready for review"
   - "⚠️ Rate limit reached on OpenAI API - waiting 60 seconds"
   - "🎉 All deliverables for Sprint 1 completed"
   - "🔄 Started working on PRIORITY 3 - Streamlit Dashboard"
   - "❌ Build failed - 3 type errors found in module X"

**Implementation Architecture**:

# Claude starts implementing feature
claude.execute_task("Implement Langfuse export functionality")

# Claude encounters decision point

    timeout=300
)

if response == "yes":

# Claude completes milestone
claude.messenger.notify_milestone(
    "✅ Export functionality complete - 45/45 tests passing",

        "tests_passed": 45,
        "files_changed": 8,
        "lines_added": 320
    }
)
```

**Benefits**:
- ✅ **Autonomous with oversight**: Claude works independently but asks when uncertain
- ✅ **Milestone visibility**: Project manager always knows current progress
- ✅ **Smart escalation**: Only critical questions interrupt project manager
- ✅ **Multi-channel**: Notifications reach project manager wherever they are
- ✅ **Audit trail**: All questions and responses logged in Langfuse
- ✅ **Safe defaults**: Timeout handling prevents Claude from making risky assumptions

**Deliverables** (added to PRIORITY 3):
- [ ] `ClaudeAgentMessenger` - Two-way messaging for Claude agent
- [ ] `EnhancedClaudeCLIInterface` - Claude CLI with messaging capabilities
- [ ] Question classification logic (critical vs routine)
- [ ] Safe default determination for timeout scenarios
- [ ] Milestone detection and notification triggers
- [ ] Integration tests for Claude ↔ Project Manager interaction
- [ ] Documentation on question patterns and safe defaults

**Timeline**: 1-2 days (8-12h) - to be added to PRIORITY 3 timeline

**Phase 1: Console Messaging Implementation** ⚡ NEW (REQUIRED):

This project implements the two-way messaging system with **console-based notifications** for the project manager UI. This is the foundational messaging channel that supports bidirectional communication for questions and milestone notifications.

**Objectives**:
- Implement console-based messaging for local project manager interaction
- Support rich formatting (colors, emojis, code blocks, panels)
- Enable interactive prompts with validation
- Provide base abstractions for future channel implementations (Phase 2)

**Architecture**:

└── config.py                    # ⚡ NEW - Channel configuration
```

**Implementation Details**:

### 1. Console Channel (Project Manager UI)

```python
from coffee_maker.autonomous.notifications.base import NotificationChannel
from rich.console import Console
from rich.panel import Panel
from rich.prompt import Prompt
import threading

class ConsoleChannel(NotificationChannel):
    """Console-based notification channel for local project manager"""

    def __init__(self, config: dict):
        self.console = Console()
        self.enabled = config.get("enabled", True)
        self.use_rich_formatting = config.get("rich_formatting", True)
        self.response_queue = {}  # {notification_id: response}

    def send_notification(self, notification: dict) -> bool:
        """Display notification in console with rich formatting"""

        if not self.enabled:
            return False

        # Format notification with rich styling
        title = notification["title"]
        message = notification.get("question") or notification.get("message")
        options = notification.get("options", [])
        priority = notification.get("priority", "medium")

        # Color based on priority
        color_map = {
            "low": "blue",
            "medium": "yellow",
            "high": "orange",
            "critical": "red"
        }
        border_style = color_map.get(priority, "blue")

        # Display notification panel
        panel = Panel(
            f"[bold]{message}[/bold]\n\n"
            f"Options: {', '.join(options)}\n"
            f"Priority: {priority}\n"
            f"Timeout: {notification.get('timeout', 300)}s",
            title=f"🤖 {title}",
            border_style=border_style,
            padding=(1, 2)
        )

        self.console.print(panel)

        return True

    def collect_input(self, notification: dict) -> str:
        """Collect input from console (blocking)"""

        options = notification.get("options", [])
        notification_id = notification["id"]

        # Prompt for input with validation
        while True:
            response = Prompt.ask(
                "[bold cyan]Your response[/bold cyan]",
                choices=options if options else None
            )

            if not options or response in options:
                self.response_queue[notification_id] = response
                return response

            self.console.print(f"[red]Invalid option. Choose from: {', '.join(options)}[/red]")

    def send_milestone(self, notification: dict) -> bool:
        """Display milestone notification (no input required)"""

        level = notification.get("level", "info")
        message = notification.get("message")
        details = notification.get("details", {})

        # Emoji based on level
        emoji_map = {
            "info": "ℹ️",
            "success": "✅",
            "warning": "⚠️",
            "error": "❌"
        }
        emoji = emoji_map.get(level, "ℹ️")

        # Color based on level
        color_map = {
            "info": "blue",
            "success": "green",
            "warning": "yellow",
            "error": "red"
        }
        color = color_map.get(level, "blue")

        self.console.print(
            f"[{color}]{emoji} {message}[/{color}]"
        )

        # Show details if present
        if details:
            self.console.print(f"[dim]{details}[/dim]")

        return True
```

### 2. Console Notifier Class

```python
from coffee_maker.autonomous.notifications.channels.console_channel import ConsoleChannel
from typing import Optional

class ConsoleNotifier:
    """Simple console-only notifier for Phase 1"""

    def __init__(self, config: dict = None):
        config = config or {}
        self.console_channel = ConsoleChannel(config.get("console", {"enabled": True}))

    def send_notification(self, notification: dict) -> bool:
        """Send notification to console"""
        return self.console_channel.send_notification(notification)

    def send_milestone(self, notification: dict) -> bool:
        """Send milestone to console"""
        return self.console_channel.send_milestone(notification)

    def collect_input(self, notification: dict, timeout: int = 300) -> Optional[str]:
        """Collect input from console"""
        return self.console_channel.collect_input(notification)
```

**Configuration Example**:

```python
# config/notifications.yaml
notifications:
  console:
    enabled: true
    rich_formatting: true

# Usage
from coffee_maker.autonomous.notifications import ConsoleNotifier

notifier = ConsoleNotifier(config["notifications"])

# Send question to console
notification = {
    "id": "q-001",
    "title": "Claude CLI Agent - Input Required",
    "question": "Should I commit the API key in .env?",
    "options": ["yes", "no", "skip"],
    "priority": "high",
    "timeout": 300
}

notifier.send_notification(notification)
response = notifier.collect_input(notification, timeout=300)

# Send milestone to console
milestone = {
    "id": "m-001",
    "title": "Claude CLI Agent - Milestone",
    "message": "✅ PRIORITY 2 implementation complete",
    "level": "success",
    "details": {
        "tests_passed": "112/112",
        "files_changed": 8,
        "duration": "2.5 hours"
    }
}

notifier.send_milestone(milestone)
```

**Key Features**:

1. **Console Channel**:
   - Rich text formatting with colors and borders
   - Priority-based styling (blue/yellow/orange/red)
   - Interactive prompts with validation
   - Immediate local feedback
   - Emoji support for visual clarity

2. **Extensible Design**:
   - Abstract base classes for future channel implementations (Phase 2)
   - Clean separation of concerns (channel, formatter, input collector)
   - Easy to add new channels without modifying existing code

**Deliverables**:
- [ ] `NotificationChannel` abstract base class
- [ ] `MessageFormatter` abstract base class
- [ ] `InputCollector` abstract base class
- [ ] `ConsoleChannel` implementation with Rich formatting
- [ ] `ConsoleNotifier` orchestrator
- [ ] Configuration system for channel settings
- [ ] Unit tests for console channel
- [ ] Integration tests with mock Claude CLI interactions
- [ ] Documentation on usage and configuration
- [ ] Example configurations for common use cases

**Timeline**: 1.5-2 days (12-16h)
- Day 1: Base classes and console channel (8-10h)
- Day 2: Notifier orchestration, testing, and documentation (4-6h)

**Dependencies**:
```bash
pip install rich
```

**Benefits of Phase 1**:
- ✅ **Immediate value**: Console notifications work out of the box
- ✅ **Foundation for Phase 2**: Clean architecture ready for Slack integration
- ✅ **No external dependencies**: Works without internet or Slack account
- ✅ **Simple setup**: Zero configuration required for basic usage

---

**Phase 2: Slack Integration** ⚡ NEW (OPTIONAL):

This project extends the messaging system with **Slack integration**, enabling remote/mobile notifications and responses. Built on top of Phase 1's abstractions, this allows the project manager to interact with Claude from anywhere via Slack.

**Objectives**:
- Implement Slack channel using Slack SDK and Block Kit
- Add interactive buttons for quick responses
- Set up webhook handler for button click events
- Provide comprehensive setup documentation for Slack app configuration
- Enable multi-channel orchestration (console + Slack simultaneously)
- Support "first response wins" pattern (project manager can respond via any channel)

**Architecture Extension**:

# Slack Integration Setup Guide

## Overview

This guide walks you through setting up Slack integration for Claude CLI notifications.
Follow these steps carefully to enable remote notifications and interactive responses.

## Prerequisites

- Slack workspace where you have admin permissions
- Public URL for webhook endpoint (use ngrok for development)
- Python environment with `slack-sdk` and `flask` installed

## Step 1: Create Slack App

1. Go to https://api.slack.com/apps
2. Click "Create New App"
3. Choose "From scratch"
4. App Name: "Claude CLI Notifications"
5. Workspace: Select your workspace
6. Click "Create App"

## Step 2: Configure Bot Permissions

1. In your app settings, go to "OAuth & Permissions"
2. Scroll to "Scopes" → "Bot Token Scopes"
3. Add the following scopes:
   - `chat:write` - Send messages
   - `chat:write.public` - Send to public channels
   - `channels:read` - List channels
   - `groups:read` - List private channels

4. Scroll up and click "Install to Workspace"
5. Click "Allow"
6. Copy the "Bot User OAuth Token" (starts with `xoxb-`)

## Step 3: Save Bot Token

Add token to your `.env` file:

```bash
SLACK_BOT_TOKEN=xoxb-your-token-here
SLACK_CHANNEL_ID=#claude-notifications
```

## Step 4: Create Notification Channel

1. In Slack, create a new channel: `#claude-notifications`
2. Invite the bot: Type `/invite @Claude CLI Notifications` in the channel

## Step 5: Set Up Webhook Endpoint

### For Development (using ngrok):

```bash
# Install ngrok
brew install ngrok  # macOS
# or download from https://ngrok.com

# Start webhook server
python coffee_maker/autonomous/notifications/webhook/server.py

# In another terminal, expose it
ngrok http 5000

# Copy the HTTPS URL (e.g., https://abc123.ngrok.io)
```

### For Production:

Deploy webhook server to your hosting provider (Heroku, AWS, etc.)
Ensure HTTPS is enabled.

## Step 6: Configure Interactive Components

1. Go back to your Slack app settings
2. Navigate to "Interactivity & Shortcuts"
3. Toggle "Interactivity" ON
4. Set "Request URL" to: `https://your-domain.com/slack/events`
5. Click "Save Changes"

## Step 7: Test the Integration

```python
from coffee_maker.autonomous.notifications import MultiChannelNotifier

config = {
    "console": {"enabled": True},
    "slack": {
        "enabled": True,
        "bot_token": "xoxb-your-token",
        "channel_id": "#claude-notifications"
    }
}

notifier = MultiChannelNotifier(config)

# Send test notification
notifier.send_notification({
    "id": "test-001",
    "title": "Test Notification",
    "question": "Is Slack integration working?",
    "options": ["yes", "no"],
    "priority": "medium",
    "timeout": 300
})

# Check Slack channel for the message with buttons
```

## Step 8: Verify Button Responses

1. Click a button in Slack
2. Check webhook server logs for incoming request
3. Message should update to show "✅ Response received: yes"

## Troubleshooting

### "Bot not found" error
- Make sure bot is invited to the channel: `/invite @Claude CLI Notifications`

### Buttons not working
- Verify webhook URL in "Interactivity & Shortcuts"
- Check webhook server logs for errors
- Ensure HTTPS is used (not HTTP)

### Messages not sent
- Verify bot token is correct
- Check bot has `chat:write` scope
- Ensure channel ID is correct (starts with # or C)

## Security Best Practices

1. **Never commit tokens**: Use `.env` file, add to `.gitignore`
2. **Verify requests**: Add Slack signature verification in webhook handler
3. **Use HTTPS only**: No HTTP in production
4. **Rotate tokens**: If compromised, regenerate in Slack app settings

## Advanced: Signature Verification

```python
import hmac
import hashlib

def verify_slack_request(request):
    """Verify request is from Slack"""

    slack_signature = request.headers.get("X-Slack-Signature")
    slack_timestamp = request.headers.get("X-Slack-Request-Timestamp")
    slack_signing_secret = os.getenv("SLACK_SIGNING_SECRET")

    # Verify timestamp (prevent replay attacks)
    if abs(time.time() - int(slack_timestamp)) > 60 * 5:
        return False

    # Compute signature
    sig_basestring = f"v0:{slack_timestamp}:{request.get_data().decode()}"
    computed_signature = "v0=" + hmac.new(
        slack_signing_secret.encode(),
        sig_basestring.encode(),
        hashlib.sha256
    ).hexdigest()

    return hmac.compare_digest(computed_signature, slack_signature)
```

**Timeline**: 2-3 days (16-20h)
- Day 1: Slack channel implementation and Block Kit formatting (8-10h)
- Day 2: Webhook handler and multi-channel orchestration (5-7h)
- Day 3: Comprehensive documentation and testing (3-4h)

**Dependencies**:
```bash
pip install slack-sdk flask requests
```

**Environment Variables**:
```bash
# .env
SLACK_BOT_TOKEN=xoxb-your-bot-token
SLACK_CHANNEL_ID=#claude-notifications
SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL=https://your-domain.com/slack/events
SLACK_SIGNING_SECRET=your-signing-secret  # For signature verification
```

**Benefits of Phase 2**:
- ✅ **Mobile access**: Respond to Claude from phone via Slack app
- ✅ **Remote work**: No need to be at console
- ✅ **Persistent history**: All notifications logged in Slack
- ✅ **Team visibility**: Other team members can see Claude's progress
- ✅ **Quick responses**: Interactive buttons for instant replies
- ✅ **Multi-channel flexibility**: Use console or Slack, whichever is convenient

**Implementation Decision Questions & Work-Around Strategy** ⚡ **INTELLIGENT BLOCKING**

**Problem**: Sometimes Claude encounters decisions that require human judgment (e.g., "Should we use SQLAlchemy or sqlite3?"). The daemon should:
1. **Ask the question intelligently** (with analysis and recommendations)
2. **Continue working on other tasks** while waiting for an answer
3. **Resume blocked task** once decision is made

**Solution: Question Queue + Task Dependency Tracking**

```python
from coffee_maker.autonomous.decision_queue import DecisionQueue, TaskDependency

class IntelligentDaemon:
    """Daemon that asks questions and works around blocked tasks"""

    def __init__(self):
        self.decision_queue = DecisionQueue()
        self.task_graph = TaskDependency()

    def encounter_decision_point(self, question: str, context: dict):
        """Claude encounters a decision that needs user input"""

        # 1. Create decision request with full analysis
        decision = self.decision_queue.create_decision(
            question=question,
            priority="PRIORITY_1",  # Current task
            context=context,
            analysis={
                "options": [

                ],
                "recommended": "Option 2",
                "reasoning": "Analytics module is isolated, sqlite3 is sufficient"
            },
            estimated_impact="4-6 hours to implement chosen option"
        )

        # 2. Notify user with structured decision request
        self.notifier.send_decision_request(decision)

        # 3. Mark current task as blocked
        self.task_graph.mark_blocked(
            task="PRIORITY_1: Analytics Module",
            blocked_by=decision.id,
            blocking_since=datetime.now()
        )

        # 4. Find work-around tasks (tasks that don't depend on this decision)
        independent_tasks = self.task_graph.find_independent_tasks(
            blocked_task="PRIORITY_1"
        )

        # 5. Continue working on independent tasks
        logger.info(f"Task blocked on decision {decision.id}")
        logger.info(f"Found {len(independent_tasks)} independent tasks to work on")

        for task in independent_tasks:
            logger.info(f"Working on: {task.name}")
            self.execute_task(task)

        # 6. Periodically check if decision is answered
        while not decision.is_answered():
            time.sleep(60)  # Check every minute

            # Continue working on other things
            if independent_tasks:
                next_task = independent_tasks.pop(0)
                self.execute_task(next_task)

        # 7. Resume blocked task once decision is made
        user_decision = decision.get_answer()
        logger.info(f"Decision received: {user_decision}")

        self.task_graph.unblock(task="PRIORITY_1")
        self.resume_task("PRIORITY_1", decision=user_decision)

**Example Workflow**:

```python
# Daemon is working on PRIORITY 1 (Analytics)
daemon.start_task("PRIORITY_1")

# Claude encounters decision point while implementing analytics module
decision = daemon.encounter_decision_point(
    question="Should we use SQLAlchemy or native sqlite3?",
    context={
        "current_code_size": "~500 lines using SQLAlchemy",
        "usage": "Only in standalone scripts",
        "current_dependencies": ["sqlalchemy==2.0.x"]
    }
)

# Daemon creates structured decision request with analysis
# Notifies user via Slack/terminal
# Marks PRIORITY_1 as blocked

# Meanwhile, daemon finds independent work:
independent_tasks = [
    "PRIORITY_2: Project Manager CLI",
    "PRIORITY_2.5: UX Documentation",
    "Code refactoring: Sprint 5"
]

# Daemon starts working on PRIORITY 2 while waiting for decision
daemon.start_task("PRIORITY_2")

# ... hours later, user responds: "Option 2"
decision.set_answer("Option 2: Use sqlite3")

# Daemon is notified of decision
daemon.on_decision_answered(decision)

# Daemon completes current task (PRIORITY 2.cli_framework)
# Then returns to blocked task (PRIORITY_1) with user's decision
daemon.resume_task("PRIORITY_1", decision="Option 2")

# Continues implementing analytics module with sqlite3
```

**Decision Database Schema**:

```sql
CREATE TABLE decision_queue (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    priority TEXT NOT NULL,           -- Which priority this affects
    task TEXT NOT NULL,                -- Specific task blocked
    question TEXT NOT NULL,            -- Question for user
    context JSON,                      -- Context/analysis data
    options JSON,                      -- Array of options with pros/cons
    recommended_option TEXT,           -- Claude's recommendation
    reasoning TEXT,                    -- Why this recommendation
    estimated_impact TEXT,             -- Time/effort estimate
    created_at DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    answered_at DATETIME,
    user_answer TEXT,                  -- User's choice
    status TEXT DEFAULT 'pending',     -- pending/answered/expired
    workaround_tasks JSON              -- Tasks daemon worked on while waiting
);

CREATE TABLE blocked_tasks (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    task_name TEXT NOT NULL,
    blocked_by_decision_id INTEGER REFERENCES decision_queue(id),
    blocked_since DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    resumed_at DATETIME,
    total_blocked_duration_seconds INTEGER
);
```

**Benefits**:
- ✅ **Intelligent blocking**: Daemon doesn't waste time waiting
- ✅ **Structured decisions**: User gets full analysis, not just raw question
- ✅ **Work continuity**: Other tasks progress while blocked task waits
- ✅ **Audit trail**: All decisions logged with context
- ✅ **Resumable**: Daemon seamlessly resumes blocked task with user's decision
- ✅ **Transparency**: User sees what daemon is doing while waiting
- ✅ **Efficiency**: Maximizes productive time, minimizes idle time

**Integration with Notification System**:

Decision requests use the same notification infrastructure (Slack, terminal, email) but with specialized formatting that includes:
- Full analysis with pros/cons
- Recommendation with reasoning
- Impact estimate
- While-you-decide status (what daemon is working on)

This transforms the daemon from a **sequential executor** into an **intelligent parallel worker** that maximizes productivity even when blocked.

### 🔴 **PRIORITY 2.5: New User Experience & Documentation** ⚡ **UX FOCUS**

**Estimated Duration**: 3-5 days
**Impact**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (Critical for adoption)
**Status**: ✅ Complete (Completed: 2025-10-09)
**Dependency**: Should be done after PRIORITY 2 (Project Manager CLI) MVP is complete
**Why Important**: New users need clear onboarding - we're too close to the code to see friction points

#### 🚨 **KNOWN ISSUE: Daemon Infinite Loop** (Discovered: 2025-10-09)

**Problem Description**:
The autonomous daemon (run_daemon.py) is stuck in an infinite loop when trying to implement PRIORITY 2.5:

1. ✅ Claude CLI executes successfully (exit code 0)
2. ❌ BUT: No files are created or modified
3. ❌ Pre-commit hooks report: "no files to check"
4. ❌ Git commit fails: nothing to commit
5. 🔄 Daemon retries same priority after 30s → infinite loop

**Log Evidence**:
```
2025-10-09 18:08:29 [INFO] Claude CLI completed with code 0
2025-10-09 18:08:30 [ERROR] Failed to commit: black...(no files to check)Skipped
2025-10-09 18:08:30 [ERROR] Failed to commit changes
2025-10-09 18:08:30 [WARNING] ⚠️  Implementation failed for PRIORITY 2.5
2025-10-09 18:08:30 [INFO] 💤 Sleeping 30s before next iteration...
```

**Root Cause Analysis**:

1. **Vague Task Description**: PRIORITY 2.5 asks for "UX audit & improvements" which is analytical, not concrete
2. **Insufficient Prompt Context**: The daemon's implementation prompt (`daemon.py:328-353`) says:
   ```python
   prompt = f"""Read docs/ROADMAP.md and implement {priority['name']}: {priority['title']}.
   Follow the roadmap guidelines and deliverables...
   Begin implementation now."""
   ```
   - Not explicit about CREATING FILES
   - Doesn't specify which deliverables to create first
   - Claude might be doing analysis without persisting results

3. **No Change Detection**: `git_manager.py:150-174` commit logic assumes changes exist:
   ```python
   if add_all:
       self._run_git("add", "-A")  # ← finds nothing
   self._run_git("commit", "-m", message)  # ← fails
   ```

4. **No Retry Logic**: `daemon.py:255-326` doesn't distinguish between:
   - "Implementation failed" (errors)
   - "Nothing to implement" (already done or unclear)
   - "Partial implementation" (needs human review)

**Status**: ✅ **FULLY FIXED** (Commit: 1064b13 - 2025-10-09 18:40+)

**Previous Fix Attempt** (Commit: a24d3be):
- Added "no changes detected" warning
- Created notification for manual review
- **BUT**: Returned `True` (success) which didn't prevent retry
- Result: Loop continued because ROADMAP still showed "📝 Planned"

**Final Solution** (Commit: 1064b13) - **Retry Limit Tracking**:

Added memory-based retry tracking to prevent infinite loops:

```python
# daemon.py __init__ (lines 94-95)
self.attempted_priorities = {}  # Track retry attempts: {priority_name: count}
self.max_retries = 3  # Maximum attempts before skipping

# daemon.py _implement_priority (lines 269-310)
attempt_count = self.attempted_priorities.get(priority_name, 0)

if attempt_count >= self.max_retries:
    logger.warning(f"⏭️  Skipping {priority_name} - already attempted {attempt_count} times")
    # Creates notification: "Max Retries Reached"
    return False  # Skip this priority, move to next

# Increment counter before attempting
self.attempted_priorities[priority_name] = attempt_count + 1
logger.info(f"🚀 Starting implementation (attempt {attempt_count+1}/{self.max_retries})")
```

**Behavior After Fix**:
- **Iteration 1-3**: Attempts PRIORITY 2.5 (logs show: "attempt 1/3", "2/3", "3/3")
- **Iteration 4+**: Skips PRIORITY 2.5 with "Max Retries Reached" notification
- **Daemon moves on** to next planned priority
- **No infinite loop** - problem solved!

**Testing Results**:
- ✅ Attributes initialize correctly (`attempted_priorities = {}`, `max_retries = 3`)
- ✅ Retry counter increments properly (0 → 1 → 2 → 3)
- ✅ Skip logic triggers after 3 attempts
- ✅ Notification created with clear action items
- ✅ No breaking changes to existing functionality

**Next Steps**:
1. Resume daemon: `python run_daemon.py --auto-approve`
2. Verify it skips PRIORITY 2.5 after 3 attempts
3. Check notification: `project-manager notifications`
4. Manually implement or clarify PRIORITY 2.5 deliverables

#### 🚨 **KNOWN ISSUE: False Positive Claude Session Detection** (Discovered: 2025-10-09)

**Problem Description**:
The daemon's Claude session detection always returns `True`, preventing daemon from running even from separate terminals.

**User Report**:
> "It also looks like there is a problem in the detection of another claude session: it is always detected even if nothing is running"

**Root Cause Analysis**:

1. **Wrong Environment Variables**: Checked for non-existent vars
   ```python
   # run_daemon.py:49-52 (OLD)
   claude_env_vars = [
       "CLAUDE_SESSION_ID",      # ❌ Doesn't exist
       "CLAUDE_CLI_SESSION",     # ❌ Doesn't exist
   ]
   ```

2. **Too Broad Process Check**: Matched ANY Claude process
   ```python
   # run_daemon.py:59-62 (OLD)
   result = subprocess.run(["pgrep", "-f", "claude"], ...)
   if result.returncode == 0:
       return True  # ❌ Always True if ANY Claude process exists
   ```

3. **False Positives**: Detected sessions incorrectly
   - Matched background Claude processes
   - Matched Claude Code running in different terminals
   - Matched unrelated processes with "claude" in name
   - Always returned `True` → blocked legitimate daemon runs

**Testing Evidence**:
```bash
$ pgrep -f "claude"
79598  # ← Always finds SOMETHING with "claude"

$ env | grep -i claude
CLAUDECODE=1                    # ✅ Actual variable (when inside Claude Code)
CLAUDE_CODE_ENTRYPOINT=cli      # ✅ Actual variable (when using CLI)
```

**Fix Applied** (Commit: c30c399):

```python
def check_claude_session():
    """Check if running inside a Claude Code session."""
    import os

    # Check for ACTUAL Claude Code environment variables
    claude_env_vars = [
        "CLAUDECODE",              # ✅ Set to "1" when inside Claude Code
        "CLAUDE_CODE_ENTRYPOINT",  # ✅ Set to "cli" when using Claude Code CLI
    ]

    for var in claude_env_vars:
        if os.environ.get(var):
            return True

    # Removed pgrep check - too broad and unreliable
    return False
```

**Testing Results**:
- ✅ Correctly detects when INSIDE Claude Code terminal (`CLAUDECODE=1`)
- ✅ Returns `False` when running from separate terminal
- ✅ No false positives from unrelated Claude processes
- ✅ More reliable session detection

**Impact**:
- Daemon can now run from separate terminals without warnings
- Still correctly warns when actually inside Claude Code
- Eliminates false positives
- Improves developer experience

**Status**: ✅ **FIXED** (Commit: c30c399)

#### 🚨 **KNOWN ISSUE: Claude CLI Permission Dialogs Block Autonomous Operation** (Discovered: 2025-10-09 19:00)

**Problem Description**:
The daemon calls Claude CLI with `-p` flag but Claude CLI asks for permission to modify files in non-interactive mode. Since the daemon can't provide interactive approval, Claude returns success (exit code 0) without actually performing any work.

**User Report**:
> "I think we are always hitting the same problem: the way you call the underlying claude-cli is not working."

**Symptoms**:
- Daemon logs show: "Claude CLI completed with code 0"
- No files are changed (working directory clean)
- Retry loop triggered (attempts same priority 3 times)
- Claude CLI sessions appear in history but no work is done

**Root Cause Analysis**:

1. **Permission Dialog in Non-Interactive Mode**: When called via subprocess:
   ```python
   # daemon calls: claude -p "Create file X"
   subprocess.run(['claude', '-p', prompt], capture_output=True, ...)
   ```

   Claude CLI response:
   ```
   I need permission to write to the file. Once you grant permission, I'll create the file...
   ```

   Result: Exit code 0 (success) but no files modified!

2. **Missing Flag**: Claude Code documentation shows:
   ```
   --dangerously-skip-permissions    Bypass all permission checks.
                                     Recommended only for sandboxes with no internet access.
   ```

   This flag was NOT being used in daemon calls.

**Testing Evidence**:

Without `--dangerously-skip-permissions`:
```python
>>> subprocess.run(['claude', '-p', 'Create hello.txt'], ...)
# Output: "I need permission to write..."
# File created: ❌ NO
```

With `--dangerously-skip-permissions`:
```python
>>> subprocess.run(['claude', '-p', '--dangerously-skip-permissions', 'Create hello.txt'], ...)
# Output: "Done! I've created the file hello.txt..."
# File created: ✅ YES
```

**Solution** (Commit: 421e982):

Updated `claude_cli_interface.py:102` to include the bypass flag:

```python
# Before (claude_cli_interface.py:101 - OLD):
cmd = [self.cli_path, "-p", prompt]

# After (claude_cli_interface.py:102 - FIXED):
cmd = [self.cli_path, "-p", "--dangerously-skip-permissions", prompt]
```

**Why This Is Safe**:
- The daemon operates in a trusted git repository (user's own project)
- All changes are tracked by git and can be reviewed/reverted
- The retry limit (max 3 attempts) prevents runaway operations
- User has full control via ROADMAP.md priorities
- This is equivalent to running Claude Code with auto-approve

**Testing Results**:
- ✅ File creation works in subprocess mode
- ✅ Daemon can now make file changes autonomously
- ✅ Exit code 0 now means "work actually done"
- ✅ No permission dialogs block execution
- ✅ Git tracks all changes for review

**Impact**:
- Daemon can now operate fully autonomously
- No more "success but no changes" false positives
- Retry logic works as intended
- User sees actual progress on priorities

**Documentation Updated**:
- Added docstring note about permission bypass
- Explained why it's needed for autonomous operation
- Documented testing methodology

**Status**: ✅ **FIXED** (Commit: 421e982 - 2025-10-09 19:01)

**Key Learning for Future Debugging**:
> When a subprocess call to Claude CLI succeeds (exit code 0) but produces no results, check if permission dialogs are being triggered in non-interactive mode. Always test subprocess calls with small examples to verify actual behavior.

#### 🚨 **PERSISTENT ISSUE: Claude CLI Still Hangs on Interactive Prompts** (Discovered: 2025-10-09 19:08)

**Problem Description**:
Even with `--dangerously-skip-permissions` flag, Claude CLI is still showing interactive warnings/dialogs and blocking the daemon:

```
2025-10-09 19:08:32 [INFO] Executing Claude CLI: Read docs/ROADMAP.md and implement PRIORITY 2.5...
⚠️  THIS IS A...
^[[O^[[I^[[O^[[I^[[O^[[I  ← Hanging with control characters (ANSI escape sequences)
```

**Root Cause**:
Claude CLI detects it's running in a TTY and shows interactive prompts even in subprocess mode with flags.

**Attempted Fix #1** (Commit: TBD):
Added stdin=subprocess.DEVNULL and CI environment variables:
```python
env = os.environ.copy()
env['CI'] = 'true'  # Signal non-interactive environment
env['DEBIAN_FRONTEND'] = 'noninteractive'

subprocess.run(
    cmd,
    stdin=subprocess.DEVNULL,  # No input available
    env=env,
    ...
)
```

**Status**: ❌ **FAILED** - stdin=DEVNULL did not resolve the issue

**Root Cause Discovered**:
The fundamental problem is that you **cannot call `claude` CLI from within a Claude Code session**. When the daemon runs `claude -p` as a subprocess from within Claude Code:
1. Claude CLI detects it's already running in a Claude session
2. Shows interactive warning: "⚠️ THIS IS A..."
3. Waits for user input that will never come (subprocess has stdin=DEVNULL)
4. Process hangs indefinitely

**This is a design limitation, not a configuration issue.**

#### ✅ **FINAL SOLUTION: Use Anthropic SDK Directly** (Implemented: 2025-10-09 19:30)

**Status**: ✅ **COMPLETE** (Commits: e997176, 40a4bc7)

After multiple failed attempts to make Claude CLI work via subprocess, we pivoted to using the Anthropic Python SDK directly. This approach:

1. **More Reliable**: No subprocess/TTY/interactive prompt issues
2. **More Efficient**: Direct API calls, no CLI overhead
3. **More Controllable**: Full control over parameters, streaming, error handling
4. **Better Observability**: Direct access to token usage, timing, etc.

**Implementation Plan**:

```python
# coffee_maker/autonomous/claude_api_interface.py (NEW)
from anthropic import Anthropic

class ClaudeAPI:
    """Direct Anthropic API interface (replaces ClaudeCLI)."""

    def __init__(self, model="claude-sonnet-4"):
        self.client = Anthropic()  # Uses ANTHROPIC_API_KEY env var
        self.model = model

    def execute_prompt(self, prompt: str, system_prompt: str = None) -> str:
        """Execute prompt via Anthropic API."""
        message = self.client.messages.create(
            model=self.model,
            max_tokens=8000,
            messages=[{"role": "user", "content": prompt}],
            system=system_prompt,
        )
        return message.content[0].text

    def execute_with_tools(self, prompt: str, tools: list) -> dict:
        """Execute prompt with tool use (for file operations)."""
        # Use Anthropic's tool calling API
        # Claude can call Edit, Write, Read, Bash tools directly
        ...
```

**Benefits**:
- ✅ No subprocess issues
- ✅ No interactive prompt issues
- ✅ No TTY detection issues
- ✅ Direct control over Claude's behavior
- ✅ Can implement streaming responses
- ✅ Better error handling
- ✅ Token usage tracking built-in

**Implementation Details**:

Commit 40a4bc7 added:
- `coffee_maker/autonomous/claude_api_interface.py` - New ClaudeAPI class
- Updated `coffee_maker/autonomous/daemon.py` - Replaced ClaudeCLI with ClaudeAPI

The migration was seamless with minimal code changes:
```python
# daemon.py changes:
# OLD:
from coffee_maker.autonomous.claude_cli_interface import ClaudeCLI
self.claude = ClaudeCLI()

# NEW:
from coffee_maker.autonomous.claude_api_interface import ClaudeAPI
self.claude = ClaudeAPI(model=self.model)
```

**Testing Results**:
- ✅ No subprocess issues
- ✅ No interactive prompt issues
- ✅ Works from within Claude Code session
- ✅ Token usage tracking built-in
- ✅ Better error handling
- ✅ More reliable and maintainable

**Key Learning**: When a tool/CLI has persistent subprocess issues, consider using the underlying SDK/API directly rather than trying to work around the limitations.

#### 📚 **DEBUGGING JOURNEY & RE-PRIORITIZATION** (2025-10-09 19:00-19:45)

**The Problem We Hit**:
We encountered a persistent blocker where the autonomous daemon couldn't make progress on ANY priorities because Claude CLI subprocess calls were hanging indefinitely. Despite multiple fix attempts, the daemon remained stuck.

**Debugging Timeline** (45 minutes of iterative problem-solving):

1. **First Attempt** (Commit: 421e982):
   - Added `--dangerously-skip-permissions` flag
   - **Result**: Still hanging with "⚠️ THIS IS A..." warning

2. **Second Attempt** (Commit: e997176):
   - Added `stdin=subprocess.DEVNULL` to prevent input
   - Added `CI=true` environment variable
   - Added `DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive`
   - **Result**: Still hanging - env vars don't stop Claude CLI's session detection

3. **Root Cause Discovery**:
   - Realized we're calling `claude` from WITHIN a Claude Code session
   - Claude CLI detects nested session and shows interactive warning
   - No flags or env vars can bypass this fundamental limitation
   - **This is a design constraint, not a bug**

**Decision Point - Hitting the Wall**:

At this point, we had two choices:
1. Keep trying to hack around Claude CLI subprocess issues (diminishing returns)
2. Pivot to a fundamentally different approach (Anthropic SDK)

**Why We Pivoted**:
- 3 fix attempts, all failed for fundamental architectural reasons
- Claude CLI subprocess approach is inherently fragile:
  - Subprocess management complexity
  - TTY detection issues
  - Permission dialog handling
  - Nested session detection
  - Cannot work from within Claude Code
- Anthropic SDK is the "right" solution:
  - Direct API calls
  - No subprocess issues
  - Better control and observability
  - More maintainable long-term

**Re-Prioritization Decision**:

Instead of continuing to debug the CLI approach, we immediately:
1. Documented all attempts in ROADMAP (learning from failures)
2. Designed the Anthropic SDK solution
3. Implemented ClaudeAPI class (40a4bc7)
4. Migrated daemon to use it
5. Tested and verified

**Time Comparison**:
- Failed CLI debugging: 45 minutes (3 attempts, no progress)
- Anthropic SDK implementation: 30 minutes (clean solution, working)

**Key Insights**:

1. **Know When to Pivot**: After 3 failed attempts addressing the same root cause from different angles, it's time to consider a fundamentally different approach

2. **Don't Fight the Tool**: Claude CLI is designed for interactive use, not subprocess automation from within Claude Code. Fighting this design is counterproductive

3. **Use the Right Tool**: When a CLI doesn't work well programmatically, use the underlying API/SDK directly

4. **Document Failures**: Every failed attempt provided valuable debugging knowledge that informed the final solution

5. **Timebox Debugging**: Set a limit (3 attempts, 1 hour, etc.) before reconsidering your approach

**What We Learned About Debugging**:

- Test small, isolated examples first (e.g., `subprocess.run(['claude', '--version'])`)
- Check if the tool is designed for your use case (interactive vs. programmatic)
- Look for official SDKs before wrapping CLIs
- Consider the execution environment (calling from within the tool itself)
- Document what you tried so you don't repeat failed approaches

**Impact on Project Priorities**:

This experience reinforced the importance of our ROADMAP approach:
- Clear priorities prevent getting stuck in rabbit holes
- Documentation of blockers helps future debugging
- Flexibility to pivot when hitting walls
- Focus on outcomes, not specific implementations

The daemon is now unblocked and can continue implementing the remaining priorities with a more reliable foundation.

#### 🔄 **IMPROVEMENT NEEDED: Crash Recovery with Context Reset** (Identified: 2025-10-09 19:05)

**Requirement**:
When the `code_developer` daemon crashes or Claude CLI fails, it should restart with a fresh, well-contextualized Claude session using `/compact` to ensure good context awareness.

**Rationale**:
- Claude sessions accumulate context over time (token usage, conversation history)
- After a crash, the context might be stale, corrupted, or irrelevant
- `/compact` creates a clean session with summarized, relevant context
- This ensures the daemon always operates with optimal context awareness
- Reduces token usage and improves response quality

**Current Behavior** (Problematic):
```python
# daemon.py - no crash recovery
def run(self):
    while self.running:
        try:
            priority = self.roadmap.get_next_priority()
            self._implement_priority(priority)  # ← If crashes, daemon stops
        except Exception as e:
            logger.error(f"Error: {e}")
            # No restart logic! ❌
```

**Proposed Solution**:

1. **Crash Detection & Recovery**:
   ```python
   # daemon.py - add crash recovery
   def run(self):
       """Main daemon loop with crash recovery."""
       crash_count = 0
       max_crashes = 3  # Prevent infinite crash loops

       while self.running:
           try:
               # Check if we should reset context
               if crash_count > 0:
                   logger.warning(f"Recovering from crash #{crash_count}")
                   self._reset_claude_context()

               priority = self.roadmap.get_next_priority()
               result = self._implement_priority(priority)

               # Success - reset crash counter
               if result:
                   crash_count = 0

           except KeyboardInterrupt:
               logger.info("Daemon stopped by user")
               break

           except Exception as e:
               crash_count += 1
               logger.error(f"💥 Daemon crashed: {e}")

               if crash_count >= max_crashes:
                   logger.error(f"Max crashes ({max_crashes}) reached - stopping daemon")
                   self.notifications.create_notification(
                       type=NOTIF_TYPE_ERROR,
                       title="Daemon Crashed Multiple Times",
                       message=f"Daemon crashed {crash_count} times and has stopped.\n\nCheck logs for details.",
                       priority=NOTIF_PRIORITY_CRITICAL,
                   )
                   break

               # Wait before retry
               logger.info(f"Restarting in 30s... (crash {crash_count}/{max_crashes})")
               time.sleep(30)
   ```

2. **Context Reset Using /compact**:
   ```python
   # daemon.py - add context reset method
   def _reset_claude_context(self):
       """Reset Claude CLI context using /compact for fresh session."""
       logger.info("🔄 Resetting Claude context with /compact...")

       try:
           # Use /compact to create a clean, well-contextualized session
           result = subprocess.run(
               ['claude', '/compact'],
               capture_output=True,
               text=True,
               timeout=30
           )

           if result.returncode == 0:
               logger.info("✅ Context reset successful")
           else:
               logger.warning(f"Context reset failed: {result.stderr}")

       except Exception as e:
           logger.error(f"Failed to reset context: {e}")
   ```

3. **Proactive Context Management**:
   ```python
   # daemon.py - add periodic context refresh
   def __init__(self, ...):
       # ...
       self.iterations_since_compact = 0
       self.compact_interval = 10  # Compact every 10 iterations

   def _implement_priority(self, priority: dict) -> bool:
       """Implement priority with periodic context refresh."""

       # Periodic context reset (every N iterations)
       self.iterations_since_compact += 1
       if self.iterations_since_compact >= self.compact_interval:
           logger.info("🔄 Periodic context refresh...")
           self._reset_claude_context()
           self.iterations_since_compact = 0

       # ... rest of implementation ...
   ```

**Alternative: Use Session Management**:
```python
# Instead of /compact, use --session-id for each task
def _implement_priority(self, priority: dict) -> bool:
    """Implement with isolated session per priority."""
    import uuid

    session_id = str(uuid.uuid4())

    cmd = [
        'claude', '-p',
        '--dangerously-skip-permissions',
        '--session-id', session_id,  # Isolated session
        prompt
    ]

    # Each priority gets a fresh session - no context pollution
```

**Benefits**:

1. **Resilience**: Daemon recovers from crashes automatically
2. **Context Quality**: Fresh context ensures relevant, high-quality responses
3. **Token Efficiency**: `/compact` reduces token usage by summarizing
4. **Debugging**: Clear crash tracking and notifications
5. **Stability**: Max crash limit prevents infinite crash loops

**Implementation Priority**:
- **Phase 1** (PRIORITY 2.6): Add crash recovery and max crash limit
- **Phase 2** (PRIORITY 2.7): Implement `/compact` context reset
- **Phase 3** (Future): Add periodic context refresh

**Success Criteria**:
- ✅ Daemon restarts after crash with fresh context
- ✅ `/compact` called before retry after crash
- ✅ Max crash limit prevents infinite loops
- ✅ Notification created for persistent crashes
- ✅ Context quality remains high across iterations

**Testing**:
```python
# Test crash recovery
def test_crash_recovery():
    daemon = DevDaemon(...)

    # Simulate crash
    def crash_once():
        if not hasattr(crash_once, 'called'):
            crash_once.called = True
            raise Exception("Simulated crash")
        return True

    daemon._implement_priority = crash_once
    daemon.run()

    # Should recover and continue
    assert crash_once.called
```

**Status**: 📝 **PLANNED** (To be implemented in PRIORITY 2.6 or 2.7)

**Key Learning**:
> Autonomous systems need crash recovery with context reset. `/compact` ensures the daemon always has fresh, relevant context after failures, improving reliability and response quality.

#### 💡 **Proposed Technical Fixes**

**Fix Option 1: Enhanced Pre-Flight Checks** (Recommended - Low Risk)

Add detection for "no changes" scenario in `daemon.py`:

```python
def _implement_priority(self, priority: dict) -> bool:
    """Implement a priority with better change detection."""

    # ... existing code ...

    # Execute Claude CLI
    result = self.claude.execute_prompt(prompt, timeout=3600)

    if not result.success:
        logger.error(f"Claude CLI failed: {result.stderr}")
        return False

    logger.info("✅ Claude CLI execution complete")

    # NEW: Check if any files were changed
    if self.git.is_clean():
        logger.warning("⚠️  Claude CLI completed but no files changed")
        logger.warning("Possible reasons:")
        logger.warning("  1. Priority already implemented")
        logger.warning("  2. Task too vague for autonomous implementation")
        logger.warning("  3. Requires human judgment/review")

        # Create notification for human review
        self.notifications.create_notification(
            type=NOTIF_TYPE_INFO,
            title=f"{priority['name']}: Needs Manual Review",
            message=f"""Claude CLI completed successfully but made no file changes.

Possible actions:
1. Review priority description - is it concrete enough?
2. Manually implement this priority
3. Mark as "Manual Only" in ROADMAP
4. Skip and move to next priority

Priority: {priority['name']}
Status: Requires human decision
""",
            priority=NOTIF_PRIORITY_HIGH,
            context={"priority_name": priority["name"], "reason": "no_changes"}
        )

        # Return "success" to avoid infinite retry
        # Human will decide next steps via notification
        return True

    # Continue with commit...
```

**Fix Option 2: Smarter Commit Logic** (Medium Risk)

Enhance `git_manager.py` to handle empty commits gracefully:

```python
def commit(self, message: str, add_all: bool = True, allow_empty: bool = False) -> bool:
    """Commit changes with better empty handling.

    Args:
        message: Commit message
        add_all: Whether to add all changes
        allow_empty: Allow empty commit (for marking progress)

    Returns:
        Tuple of (success: bool, had_changes: bool)
    """
    try:
        if add_all:
            self._run_git("add", "-A")

        # Check if there are changes to commit
        result = self._run_git("status", "--porcelain", check=False)
        has_changes = len(result.stdout.strip()) > 0

        if not has_changes and not allow_empty:
            logger.warning("No changes to commit")
            return (False, False)  # Return tuple: (success, had_changes)

        commit_args = ["commit", "-m", message]
        if not has_changes and allow_empty:
            commit_args.append("--allow-empty")

        self._run_git(*commit_args)
        logger.info(f"Committed: {message[:50]}...")
        return (True, has_changes)

    except subprocess.CalledProcessError as e:
        logger.error(f"Failed to commit: {e.stderr}")
        return (False, False)
```

**Fix Option 3: Task-Specific Prompts** (High Value - Requires More Work)

Create specialized prompt builder for different priority types:

```python
def _build_implementation_prompt(self, priority: dict) -> str:
    """Build context-aware prompt based on priority type."""

    # Detect priority type
    if "documentation" in priority["title"].lower() or "ux" in priority["title"].lower():
        return self._build_documentation_prompt(priority)
    elif "test" in priority["title"].lower():
        return self._build_testing_prompt(priority)
    else:
        return self._build_feature_prompt(priority)

def _build_documentation_prompt(self, priority: dict) -> str:
    """Build explicit documentation creation prompt."""
    return f"""Read docs/ROADMAP.md and implement {priority['name']}: {priority['title']}.

THIS IS A DOCUMENTATION PRIORITY. You MUST create the following files:

Required Deliverables (from ROADMAP):
1. docs/USER_JOURNEY_PROJECT_MANAGER.md
2. docs/QUICKSTART_PROJECT_MANAGER.md
3. docs/SLACK_SETUP_GUIDE.md
4. docs/PROJECT_MANAGER_FEATURES.md

Instructions:
- CREATE each file listed above
- Use the templates provided in ROADMAP as starting points
- Fill in real content based on existing codebase
- Be specific, not generic
- Include actual commands and examples
- Test examples before documenting them

Start with file #1 (USER_JOURNEY_PROJECT_MANAGER.md) and work through all 4 files.

When done:
- Update ROADMAP.md status to "✅ Complete"
- List all files created in your summary

Begin implementation now - CREATE THE FILES."""
```

**Fix Option 4: Skip Mechanism** (Quick Mitigation)

Add ability to skip problematic priorities:

```python
# In roadmap_parser.py
def mark_priority_skipped(self, priority_name: str, reason: str):
    """Mark a priority as skipped for manual implementation."""
    # Update ROADMAP with "⏭️ Skipped (Manual)" status
    pass

# In daemon.py
def _implement_priority(self, priority: dict) -> bool:
    # ... after detecting no changes ...

    # Check if this priority has been retried too many times
    retry_count = self._get_retry_count(priority["name"])

    if retry_count >= 3:
        logger.error(f"Priority {priority['name']} failed 3 times - skipping")
        self.parser.mark_priority_skipped(
            priority["name"],
            "Autonomous implementation failed - requires manual work"
        )
        return True  # Return success to move to next priority
```

- Record demo videos/GIFs
- Review with fresh eyes (ideally external reviewer)

**Phase 3: UX Improvements** (2 days)
- Implement CLI help improvements
- Add interactive setup wizard
- Improve error messages (top 10 most common)
- Add self-diagnosis tool
- Add tutorial mode

**Phase 4: Validation** (half day)
- Test with new user (friend/colleague)
- Gather feedback
- Iterate on confusing parts
- Final polish

#### Benefits

- ✅ **Faster adoption**: New users productive in minutes, not hours
- ✅ **Reduced support burden**: Self-service documentation and diagnosis
- ✅ **Better first impression**: Professional, polished experience
- ✅ **Increased confidence**: Clear guidance reduces frustration
- ✅ **Scalability**: Documentation enables team adoption
- ✅ **Community growth**: Easy onboarding → more contributors
- ✅ **Foundation for daemon**: Good UX patterns established before AI takes over

**Note**: This priority can be completed BEFORE daemon implementation. It establishes UX patterns that the daemon can follow when autonomously working on future features.

### 🔴 **PRIORITY 2.6: code_developer Functional Testing & CI Integration** ✅ **COMPLETE**

**Estimated Duration**: 1 day (8 hours)
**Impact**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (Critical - blocks all future development)
**Status**: ✅ Complete - **IMPLEMENTED 2025-10-11**
**Dependency**: None (self-contained testing infrastructure)
**Why Important**: **Must guarantee code_developer remains functional for end users**

#### Project: Comprehensive CI Test Suite for code_developer

**Problem Statement**:
The `code_developer` daemon is the core autonomous development engine. If it breaks, users lose the ability to develop autonomously. We need a comprehensive CI test suite that **guarantees** the daemon works for end users before any code reaches production.

**Objectives**:
1. **User Scenario Testing**: Test critical user workflows end-to-end
2. **CI Integration**: Automated tests on every PR/merge
3. **Both Modes**: Test Claude CLI mode AND Anthropic API mode
4. **Regression Prevention**: Catch breaking changes before deployment
5. **User Confidence**: Users can trust the daemon works

**Success Criteria**:
- ✅ All tests pass on CI before merge
- ✅ Tests cover 90%+ of user scenarios
- ✅ Tests run in <10 minutes
- ✅ Clear test failure messages guide debugging
- ✅ Both CLI and API modes tested

**Deliverables**:

#### **1. CI Test Structure** (`tests/ci_tests/` - New Directory)

Create a dedicated `tests/ci_tests/` directory with complete test coverage:

**Test Execution** (Automated via GitHub Actions):
```yaml
# GitHub Actions runs these automatically on merge/release:

# Step 1: Unit tests (fast)
- run: pytest tests/autonomous/test_daemon_regression.py -m "not integration"

# Step 2: Integration tests (on releases only)
- run: pytest tests/autonomous/test_daemon_regression.py -m integration

# Step 3: Daemon health check
- run: python scripts/check_daemon_health.py
```

**No manual testing required** - GitHub Actions handles everything automatically

**6. Release Checklist** (`docs/RELEASE_CHECKLIST.md`)
```markdown

**7. Documentation** (`docs/DAEMON_TESTING.md`)
```markdown
# Daemon Testing Guide

## Production Monitoring

1. Daemon runs continuously: `python run_daemon.py --auto-approve`
2. Monitor logs for issues
3. Check notifications: `poetry run project-manager notifications`
4. **Testing**: GitHub Actions runs all tests automatically on merge to main

## CI Testing

GitHub Actions runs daemon tests on:
- **Significant releases** (published releases, version tags)
- **PRs to main** (before merging major changes)
- **Manual dispatch** (on-demand testing when needed)

Tests verify:
- No infinite loops (priority not retried >3 times)
- Notifications created for blocked tasks
- Daemon progresses through roadmap
- Core functionality intact (non-regression)

## Troubleshooting

If daemon gets stuck:
1. Check logs for "no files changed" warnings
2. Verify notification created
3. Review priority description for vagueness
4. Consider manual implementation
```

**Success Criteria**:
- ✅ Daemon resumes and moves past PRIORITY 2.5 (no infinite loop)
- ✅ GitHub Actions workflow created (`.github/workflows/daemon-test.yml`)
- ✅ Health check scripts created (`scripts/check_daemon_health.py`)
- ✅ Non-regression tests created (`tests/autonomous/test_daemon_regression.py`)
- ✅ Environment variables configured in GitHub (Settings → Secrets → ANTHROPIC_API_KEY)
- ✅ **Tests run automatically on merge to main** (no manual testing needed)
- ✅ Documentation complete

**Risk Assessment**:
- **Low risk**: Testing doesn't change production code
- **High value**: Prevents future infinite loops
- **Quick win**: Can be done in 2-4 hours

**Next Steps After Completion**:
1. Resume daemon with confidence
2. Monitor GitHub Actions for issues
3. Iterate on health checks as needed
4. Consider adding metrics dashboard

### 🔴 **PRIORITY 2.65: Daemon End-to-End Validation (Outside Claude Session)** ⚡ **VALIDATION**

**Estimated Duration**: 1-2 hours
**Impact**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (Critical - validates daemon actually works for users)
**Status**: ✅ Partially Complete - Bug fixed, needs full E2E test
**Dependency**: None (can be done immediately)
**Why Important**: Must validate daemon works outside Claude session before marking as production-ready

#### Issues Found During Testing

**Testing Performed** (Oct 10, 2025):
- ✅ Daemon initialization: Works
- ✅ Prerequisites check: Works
- ✅ ROADMAP parsing: Works
- ✅ Claude CLI availability: Works
- ✅ Prompt generation: Works
- 🐛 **BUG FOUND & FIXED**: Model name "claude-sonnet-4" → "sonnet"

**Bug Details**:
```
Error: API Error: 404 {"type":"error","error":{"type":"not_found_error","message":"model: claude-sonnet-4"}}
Root Cause: Model "claude-sonnet-4" doesn't exist
Fix: Changed default to "sonnet" (correct alias)
Fixed in commit: c13eb6f
```

**Limitation**: Testing was performed inside a Claude Code session, which may interfere with full daemon operation.

#### Deliverables

**1. Full E2E Test Outside Claude Session**

Run daemon in a **separate terminal** (not inside Claude Code) to validate complete workflow:

```bash
# Terminal 1 (separate from Claude Code)
cd /path/to/MonolithicCoffeeMakerAgent
poetry run code-developer --verbose --no-pr

# Expected behavior:
# 1. ✅ Initializes successfully
# 2. ✅ Finds next planned priority (PRIORITY 2.6)
# 3. ✅ Creates notification for approval
# 4. ✅ Waits for user response

# Terminal 2 (check notifications)
poetry run project-manager notifications

# Terminal 2 (approve)
poetry run project-manager respond <NOTIF_ID> approve

# Terminal 1 should then:
# 5. ✅ Create feature branch
# 6. ✅ Execute Claude CLI
# 7. ✅ Commit changes
# 8. ✅ (Skip PR since --no-pr)
# 9. ✅ Mark priority complete
# 10. ✅ Sleep and continue to next priority
```

**2. Verify All Model References**

Check and update all remaining "claude-sonnet-4" references:

```bash
# Find all occurrences
grep -r "claude-sonnet-4" --include="*.py" --include="*.md" coffee_maker/ docs/

# Update to either:
# - "sonnet" (recommended - simple alias)
# - "claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929" (full version - more specific)

# Files already fixed:
# ✅ coffee_maker/autonomous/daemon_cli.py
# ✅ coffee_maker/autonomous/daemon.py
# ✅ coffee_maker/autonomous/claude_cli_interface.py

# Files that may need updating:
# ⏳ coffee_maker/autonomous/claude_api_interface.py
# ⏳ coffee_maker/cli/ai_service.py
# ⏳ coffee_maker/code_reviewer/ (multiple files)
# ⏳ streamlit_apps/ (multiple files)
# ⏳ Documentation files (ROADMAP.md, etc.)
```

**3. Document Testing Limitations**

Add to docs/DAEMON_TESTING.md:

```markdown
## Testing Limitations

### Cannot Test Inside Claude Code Session

The daemon **cannot be fully tested** inside a Claude Code session because:
1. Environment variables conflict (CLAUDECODE=1, CLAUDE_CODE_ENTRYPOINT=cli)
2. Claude CLI may already be in use
3. Resource contention between sessions

### Correct Testing Approach

**Option A: Separate Terminal** (Recommended)
```bash
# Open a new terminal (NOT in Claude Code)
cd /path/to/project
poetry run code-developer --verbose
```

**Option B: Dedicated Repository Copy**
```bash
# Create isolated copy for daemon testing
cp -r project/ daemon-test/
cd daemon-test/
poetry run code-developer --auto-approve
```

**Option C: Manual Tests Directory**
```bash
# Run manual E2E tests (requires --run-e2e flag)
pytest tests/manual_tests/test_daemon_e2e.py -v -s --run-e2e
```
```

**4. Update CLAUDE_CLI_MODE.md**

Document the model name issue and correct usage:

```markdown
## Model Configuration

### Default Model

The daemon uses `model="sonnet"` by default. This is the Claude CLI alias for the latest Sonnet model.

### Available Models

Check available models:
```bash
claude -p --help | grep model
```

Use specific model:
```bash
code-developer --model sonnet                    # Latest Sonnet (recommended)
code-developer --model opus                      # Latest Opus
code-developer --model claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929  # Specific version
```

### Common Issues

**Error: 404 model not found**
```
API Error: 404 {"type":"error","error":{"type":"not_found_error","message":"model: claude-sonnet-4"}}
```

**Cause**: Invalid model name (e.g., "claude-sonnet-4" doesn't exist)

**Solution**: Use correct model alias or full name:
- ✅ `--model sonnet`
- ✅ `--model claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929`
- ❌ `--model claude-sonnet-4` (doesn't exist)
```

**Success Criteria**:
- ✅ Daemon runs successfully outside Claude session
- ✅ All "claude-sonnet-4" references updated or documented
- ✅ Testing limitations documented
- ✅ E2E test completes without errors
- ✅ User can confidently run daemon in production

**Acceptance Test**:
```bash
# User runs daemon for first time
poetry run code-developer --auto-approve

# Expected:
# ✅ No 404 model errors
# ✅ Claude CLI executes successfully
# ✅ Daemon implements at least one priority
# ✅ Creates commit and branch
# ✅ Sleeps and continues to next priority
```

### 🔴 **PRIORITY 2.7: Daemon Crash Recovery & Context Management** 🔄 **RELIABILITY**

**Estimated Duration**: 4-6 hours
**Impact**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (Critical for autonomous reliability)
**Status**: ✅ Complete (Implemented in daemon.py)
**Dependency**: Requires PRIORITY 2.6 completion
**Why Important**: Autonomous systems need crash recovery and context management to ensure continuous operation

#### Project: Implement Crash Recovery with Context Reset

**Objectives**:
1. Add crash detection and automatic recovery
2. Implement `/compact` context reset after crashes
3. Add periodic context refresh to prevent context pollution
4. Create crash notifications for persistent failures
5. Test crash recovery with simulated failures

**Background**:
> "When the code_developer crashes, it should be restarted with a very task: /compact in order to have a claude with good context awareness"

Currently, if the daemon crashes:
- ❌ It stops completely (no auto-recovery)
- ❌ Context accumulates over time (token bloat)
- ❌ No context reset after failures (stale context)
- ❌ No crash tracking or limits (potential infinite crashes)

**Deliverables**:

**1. Crash Recovery Logic** (`coffee_maker/autonomous/daemon.py`)

```python
def run(self):
    """Main daemon loop with crash recovery."""
    crash_count = 0
    max_crashes = 3  # Prevent infinite crash loops

    while self.running:
        try:
            # Reset context after crash
            if crash_count > 0:
                logger.warning(f"🔄 Recovering from crash #{crash_count}")
                self._reset_claude_context()

            priority = self.roadmap.get_next_priority()

            if not priority:
                logger.info("✅ No more priorities - daemon complete")
                break

            result = self._implement_priority(priority)

            # Success - reset crash counter
            if result:
                crash_count = 0

            # Sleep before next iteration
            logger.info(f"💤 Sleeping {self.sleep_interval}s before next iteration...")
            time.sleep(self.sleep_interval)

        except KeyboardInterrupt:
            logger.info("\n⏹️  Daemon stopped by user")
            break

        except Exception as e:
            crash_count += 1
            logger.error(f"💥 Daemon crashed: {e}")
            logger.error(f"Stack trace:", exc_info=True)

            if crash_count >= max_crashes:
                logger.error(f"❌ Max crashes ({max_crashes}) reached - stopping daemon")
                self.notifications.create_notification(
                    type=NOTIF_TYPE_ERROR,
                    title="Daemon Crashed Multiple Times",
                    message=f"""The daemon has crashed {crash_count} times and has stopped.

Error: {str(e)}

Please check logs for details:
  tail -f logs/daemon.log

To restart:
  python run_daemon.py --auto-approve
""",
                    priority=NOTIF_PRIORITY_CRITICAL,
                    context={
                        "crash_count": crash_count,
                        "error": str(e),
                    }
                )
                break

            # Wait before retry (exponential backoff)
            wait_time = min(30 * (2 ** (crash_count - 1)), 300)  # Max 5 min
            logger.info(f"⏳ Restarting in {wait_time}s... (crash {crash_count}/{max_crashes})")
            time.sleep(wait_time)
```

**2. Context Reset Method** (`coffee_maker/autonomous/daemon.py`)

```python
def _reset_claude_context(self):
    """Reset Claude CLI context using /compact for fresh session.

    This ensures the daemon always has good context awareness after
    crashes or long-running sessions.
    """
    logger.info("🔄 Resetting Claude context with /compact...")

    try:
        # Method 1: Use /compact command
        result = subprocess.run(
            ['claude', '/compact'],
            capture_output=True,
            text=True,
            timeout=60,
            input="",  # Auto-confirm any prompts
        )

        if result.returncode == 0:
            logger.info("✅ Context reset successful")
            return True
        else:
            logger.warning(f"⚠️  Context reset returned non-zero: {result.stderr}")
            return False

    except subprocess.TimeoutExpired:
        logger.error("❌ Context reset timed out")
        return False

    except Exception as e:
        logger.error(f"❌ Failed to reset context: {e}")
        return False
```

**3. Periodic Context Refresh** (`coffee_maker/autonomous/daemon.py`)

```python
def __init__(self, ...):
    # ... existing code ...

    # Context management
    self.iterations_since_compact = 0
    self.compact_interval = 10  # Compact every 10 iterations
    logger.info(f"Context refresh interval: {self.compact_interval} iterations")

def _implement_priority(self, priority: dict) -> bool:
    """Implement a priority with periodic context refresh."""

    # Periodic context reset to prevent token bloat
    self.iterations_since_compact += 1
    if self.iterations_since_compact >= self.compact_interval:
        logger.info(f"🔄 Periodic context refresh (every {self.compact_interval} iterations)...")
        self._reset_claude_context()
        self.iterations_since_compact = 0

    # ... rest of implementation ...
```

**4. Alternative: Isolated Sessions Per Priority**

```python
def _implement_priority(self, priority: dict) -> bool:
    """Implement with isolated session per priority."""
    import uuid

    # Create unique session ID for this priority
    session_id = str(uuid.uuid4())
    logger.info(f"🆔 Using isolated session: {session_id[:8]}...")

    # Build command with session isolation
    cmd = [
        'claude', '-p',
        '--dangerously-skip-permissions',
        '--session-id', session_id,  # Each priority gets fresh session
        prompt
    ]

    # No context pollution between priorities!
    result = subprocess.run(cmd, ...)
```

**5. Crash Recovery Tests** (`tests/autonomous/test_crash_recovery.py`)

```python
def test_daemon_recovers_from_single_crash():
    """Test daemon recovers from a single crash."""
    daemon = DevDaemon(...)

    # Simulate crash on first call
    crash_once = MockCrashOnce()
    daemon._implement_priority = crash_once.execute

    daemon.run()

    # Should recover and continue
    assert crash_once.call_count == 2  # Failed once, succeeded once
    assert daemon.crash_count == 0  # Reset after success

def test_daemon_stops_after_max_crashes():
    """Test daemon stops after max crashes."""
    daemon = DevDaemon(...)
    daemon.max_crashes = 3

    # Always crash
    daemon._implement_priority = lambda p: exec('raise Exception("Always crash")')

    daemon.run()

    # Should stop after 3 crashes
    assert daemon.crash_count == 3
    # Should create critical notification
    notifications = daemon.notifications.list_notifications()
    assert any(n.priority == NOTIF_PRIORITY_CRITICAL for n in notifications)
```

**Success Criteria**:
- ✅ Daemon recovers automatically from crashes
- ✅ Context reset with `/compact` after each crash
- ✅ Periodic context refresh every N iterations
- ✅ Max crash limit prevents infinite crash loops
- ✅ Critical notification created for persistent crashes
- ✅ Exponential backoff between crash retries
- ✅ Tests verify crash recovery behavior
- ✅ Logging shows crash count and recovery status

**Configuration** (`config.yaml`):
```yaml
daemon:
  crash_recovery:
    enabled: true
    max_crashes: 3
    backoff_initial: 30  # seconds
    backoff_max: 300     # 5 minutes

  context_management:
    compact_enabled: true
    compact_interval: 10  # iterations
    isolated_sessions: false  # Use session-id per priority
```

**Benefits**:
1. **Resilience**: Daemon continues working despite failures
2. **Context Quality**: Fresh context ensures high-quality responses
3. **Token Efficiency**: `/compact` reduces token usage
4. **Debugging**: Clear crash tracking and notifications
5. **Stability**: Max crash limit prevents runaway behavior

**Implementation Priority**: **HIGH** (Should be done immediately after PRIORITY 2.6)

**Testing Plan**:
1. Simulate crashes during priority implementation
2. Verify context reset happens before retry
3. Test max crash limit stops daemon
4. Verify notification creation for critical crashes
5. Test periodic context refresh
6. Monitor token usage with/without context reset

**Risk Assessment**:
- **Low risk**: Defensive coding, doesn't change core logic
- **High value**: Enables true autonomous operation
- **Quick win**: 4-6 hours implementation

**Next Steps After Completion**:
1. Monitor daemon stability in production
2. Track crash rates and causes
3. Optimize compact interval based on token usage
4. Consider implementing isolated sessions

**Data Schema** (from Langfuse export):

The dashboard queries the `traces` and `events` tables in SQLite:

```python
# Example query structure
"""
SELECT
    traces.id,
    traces.name,
    traces.timestamp,
    traces.metadata,
    traces.status_message,  -- Error messages
    events.level,           -- 'ERROR', 'WARNING', etc.
    events.message,
    events.body,           -- Full error details
    generations.model,
    generations.model_parameters,
    generations.prompt_tokens,
    generations.completion_tokens,
    generations.total_cost
FROM traces
LEFT JOIN events ON traces.id = events.trace_id
LEFT JOIN generations ON traces.id = generations.trace_id

db_path = "data/analytics/langfuse_traces.db"
engine = create_engine(f"sqlite:///{db_path}")

# Query for errors
query = """
SELECT
    t.id as trace_id,
    t.name,
    t.timestamp,
    t.status_message as error_message,
    e.level,
    e.message,
    e.body,
    g.model,
    g.total_cost,
    g.prompt_tokens,
    g.completion_tokens
FROM traces t
LEFT JOIN events e ON t.id = e.trace_id
LEFT JOIN generations g ON t.id = g.trace_id
WHERE (e.level = 'ERROR' OR t.status_message IS NOT NULL)
  AND t.timestamp >= datetime('now', '-24 hours')

### 🔴 **PRIORITY 8: Multi-AI Provider Support** 🌍 **USER ADOPTION**

**Estimated Duration**: 2-3 weeks
**Impact**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
**Status**: ✅ **COMPLETE** (2025-10-12)
**Dependency**: Should be done after PRIORITY 3 (Autonomous Development Daemon) is stable
**Strategic Goal**: **Increase user adoption** by supporting multiple AI providers
**Note**: Fully implemented with Claude, OpenAI, and Gemini support! 🎉

#### Why This Is Critical

Currently, the `code-developer` daemon is tightly coupled to Claude via the Claude CLI. While Claude is excellent, **this creates barriers to adoption**:

1. **Cost Flexibility**: Users may want to use cheaper models for simple tasks
2. **Feature Availability**: Some users may not have access to Claude in their region
3. **Model Preferences**: Different developers prefer different AI tools
4. **Competitive Landscape**: By the time this is implemented, new models may emerge
5. **Risk Mitigation**: Dependency on a single provider creates business risk

**Business Impact**: Supporting OpenAI, Gemini, and emerging models can **significantly increase user adoption** and make the tool more accessible globally.

#### Project: AI Provider Abstraction Layer

**Goal**: Allow `code-developer` to work with multiple AI providers while maintaining the same high-quality autonomous development experience.

#### Supported Providers (Initial)

1. **Claude** (Anthropic) - Current, remains default ✅
   - Via Claude CLI or API
   - Best for complex reasoning and code generation

2. **OpenAI** (GPT-4, GPT-4 Turbo, o1, o3) 🆕
   - Via OpenAI API
   - Widest adoption, familiar to most developers

3. **Gemini** (Google) 🆕
   - Via Gemini API
   - Competitive pricing, strong code capabilities

4. **Future-Proof Design** 🔮
   - Pluggable architecture to easily add new providers
   - Monitor AI developer community for emerging popular models
   - Examples: DeepSeek, Mistral, Llama (via Ollama), etc.

### 🔴 **PRIORITY 6.5: GCP Deployment of code_developer** ☁️ **CLOUD INFRASTRUCTURE**

**Estimated Duration**: 2-3 weeks
**Impact**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (Critical for continuous autonomous operation)
**Status**: ✅ Complete (2025-10-12) - Documentation phase complete
**Completed By**: Claude Code (Documentation implementation)
**Dependency**: Should be done after Streamlit dashboards (PRIORITY 5, 5.5, 6) and PRIORITY 3 (Autonomous Development Daemon) is stable
**Strategic Goal**: Deploy code_developer on GCP for 24/7 autonomous operation with project_manager integration
**Note**: Documentation complete! Ready for actual GCP deployment when prerequisites are met. 🚀

#### ✅ Completed Deliverables (2025-10-12)

**Documentation Phase** (All files created with real, tested content):
- ✅ **docs/GCP_DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md** - Complete step-by-step deployment guide (400+ lines)
- ✅ **docs/GCP_SETUP.md** - GCP account setup and prerequisites (500+ lines)
- ✅ **docs/TROUBLESHOOTING_GCP.md** - Common issues and solutions (600+ lines)
- ✅ **docs/OPERATIONS_RUNBOOK.md** - Operational procedures and runbooks (800+ lines)

**Infrastructure Files Already Present**:
- ✅ **coffee_maker/deployment/Dockerfile** - Multi-stage container build
- ✅ **coffee_maker/deployment/docker-compose.yml** - Local testing environment
- ✅ **coffee_maker/deployment/healthcheck.sh** - Container health checks
- ✅ **coffee_maker/deployment/requirements-deploy.txt** - Production dependencies

**Total Documentation**: 2,300+ lines of comprehensive, production-ready deployment documentation

**Next Steps for Actual Deployment**:
1. Set up GCP account with billing (follow docs/GCP_SETUP.md)
2. Test container locally with docker-compose
3. Deploy to Cloud Run (follow docs/GCP_DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md)
4. Configure monitoring and alerts
5. Verify 24/7 operation

#### Why This Is Critical

Currently, the `code_developer` daemon runs locally on the developer's machine. **This creates significant limitations**:

1. **Availability**: Daemon stops when laptop sleeps or shuts down
2. **Accessibility**: Cannot work on tasks when away from development machine
3. **Resource Constraints**: Limited by local machine resources (CPU, memory, disk)
4. **Reliability**: Vulnerable to local network issues, power outages, system crashes
5. **Scalability**: Cannot run multiple daemons for different projects simultaneously
6. **Professional Workflow**: Real development teams work 24/7 - AI developers should too

**Business Impact**: Deploying on GCP enables **truly autonomous, always-on development** that continues working even when the user is offline.

#### Project: GCP-Based Autonomous Development Infrastructure

**Goal**: Deploy `code_developer` daemon on Google Cloud Platform with full integration to `project_manager` CLI for seamless remote control and monitoring.

### 🔴 **PRIORITY 9: Enhanced code_developer Communication & Daily Standup** 🗣️ **PROFESSIONAL WORKFLOW**

**Estimated Duration**: 1-2 weeks
**Impact**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (Critical for trust and visibility)
**Status**: ✅ **COMPLETE** (2025-10-17, docs updated 2025-10-18)
**Completed By**: code_developer
**Implementation Time**: ~1 week
**Commits**: 22c7bee1b0581724d1c07365093226e24289ac48
**Documentation**:
  - ✅ Implementation complete (standup_generator.py, activity_db.py, CLI integration)
  - ✅ User Guide: docs/PRIORITY_9_USER_GUIDE.md (Comprehensive 400+ line guide)
  - ✅ Architecture Documentation: docs/PRIORITY_9_ARCHITECTURE.md (Technical deep-dive)
  - ✅ Usage Examples: docs/PRIORITY_9_EXAMPLES.md (Real command outputs and workflows)
**Tests**: 28 passing (19 unit + 9 integration)
**Dependency**: Should be done after PRIORITY 3 (Autonomous Development Daemon) is stable
**Strategic Goal**: Make `code_developer` communicate like a real team member with daily status updates

#### Why This Is Important

Currently, the `code_developer` daemon works silently in the background. While it creates notifications and commits, **users lack visibility into daily progress and overall status**:

1. **Trust Building**: Users need to see what the AI developer accomplished each day
2. **Progress Tracking**: Daily summaries help track momentum and identify blockers
3. **Team Integration**: Professional developers provide standups - AI should too
4. **Accountability**: Clear reporting of work done builds confidence in the system
5. **Context Awareness**: Summaries help users understand where the project stands

**Business Impact**: Daily communication transforms the daemon from a "background process" to a **trusted team member**, increasing user engagement and adoption.

#### Project: Professional AI Developer Communication

**Goal**: Make `code_developer` communicate progress, accomplishments, and status just like a professional human developer on an agile team.

**Implementation Model**: The `project_manager` acts as the communication interface. When the user checks in (e.g., starts a new day with `project-manager chat`), the project manager **first reports what the code_developer accomplished** since the last check-in, then proceeds with the conversation.

**Example Workflow**:
```bash
$ project-manager chat

🤖 project-manager: Good morning! Before we start, here's what
   code_developer accomplished yesterday:

📊 Daily Update - 2025-10-09:
✅ Completed PRIORITY 2.5 - Fixed daemon infinite loop
   - Added retry limit tracking (3 attempts max)
   - Created notification system for blocked priorities
   - All tests passing | Coverage: 87% (+2%)
   - Commits: 2 | PRs: 1

🔄 Current Status:
   - Working on PRIORITY 2.6 - CI Testing (50% complete)
   - ETA: 2-3 hours remaining

⚠️ Needs Your Attention:
   - PRIORITY 2.5 documentation may need manual review
   - Check notification #5 for details

Now, how can I help you today?

> _
```

This creates a natural flow where the project manager keeps you informed about the developer's progress without requiring manual queries.

**Smart Detection**: The project manager detects when it's a "new day" (first interaction after midnight or >12 hours since last chat) and automatically provides the daily summary before proceeding with the conversation.

### 🎯 Git Best Practices

1. **Atomic commits**: 1 commit = 1 logical change
2. **Descriptive messages**: Explain the "why", not the "what"
3. **Daily push**: Backup and visibility on progress
4. **Short branches**: Merge regularly (< 1 week of work)
5. **Tags on milestones**: Facilitates rollback and tracking
6. **Up-to-date CHANGELOG**: Document changes for users
7. **Review before merge**: Verify tests pass and code is clean

### 🚨 What to Avoid

- ❌ Too large commits (> 500 lines modified)
- ❌ Vague messages ("fix bug", "update code")
- ❌ Direct commits on main (always use a branch)
- ❌ Forgetting to push (risk of work loss)
- ❌ Merging untested code
- ❌ Keeping feature branches open too long

---

## 📦 Technology Selection Guidelines

**Principle**: Before implementing any new project, carefully evaluate the technology stack to ensure faster, shorter, and more reliable implementation.

### 🎯 Core Philosophy

**Prioritize well-known, massively-used, open-source projects** that:
- Have large, active communities
- Are battle-tested in production
- Have extensive documentation and examples
- Are actively maintained
- Have stable APIs

### 📋 Pre-Implementation Checklist

Before starting any new priority, **MANDATORY** analysis:

#### 1. **Evaluate Current Stack** (30min-1h)
- [ ] Review existing dependencies in `requirements.txt` / `pyproject.toml`
- [ ] Identify which existing libraries can be reused
- [ ] Check if current stack already provides the needed functionality
- [ ] Avoid adding new dependencies if existing ones can solve the problem

#### 2. **Research Best Practices** (1-2h)
- [ ] Search for industry-standard solutions for the problem domain
- [ ] Consult GitHub trending, PyPI stats, and community recommendations
- [ ] Read recent blog posts and tutorials (last 1-2 years)
- [ ] Check StackOverflow for common patterns and gotchas

#### 3. **Dependency Evaluation Criteria**

For each potential new dependency, evaluate:

| Criterion | Threshold | Why It Matters |
|-----------|-----------|----------------|
| **GitHub Stars** | > 5,000 | Community adoption indicator |
| **Weekly Downloads** | > 100,000 (PyPI) | Production usage indicator |
| **Last Commit** | < 6 months | Active maintenance |
| **Open Issues** | < 500 unresolved | Maintainer responsiveness |
| **Documentation** | Comprehensive + examples | Ease of implementation |
| **License** | MIT, Apache 2.0, BSD | Commercial-friendly |
| **Python Version** | Supports 3.10+ | Modern compatibility |
| **Dependencies** | Minimal transitive deps | Reduced complexity |

### 🤖 For Autonomous Daemon

The autonomous development daemon (Priority 3) **MUST**:
1. Read this section before implementing any priority
2. Create a technology decision document in `docs/tech_decisions/`
3. Justify each new dependency with evaluation criteria
4. Prefer existing dependencies over new ones
5. Update this section if new standard technologies emerge

---

## 🔄 Continuous Improvement Practice (Between Each Project)

**Principle**: After each completed project, take time to improve existing code before starting the next one.

### 📋 Continuous Improvement Checklist

To do **systematically** between each project:

#### 0. **Technology Stack Review** (30min-1h) ⚡ NEW
- [ ] Review dependencies added during the project
- [ ] Verify all new dependencies meet the criteria in "Technology Selection Guidelines"
- [ ] Document technology decisions in `docs/tech_decisions/`
- [ ] Check for unused dependencies and remove them
- [ ] Update dependency versions to latest stable releases (if safe)
- [ ] Ensure all dependencies are properly documented in requirements

**Reference**: See **Technology Selection Guidelines** section above

#### 1. **Refactoring Analysis** (2-4h)
- [ ] Identify refactoring opportunities in recently written code
- [ ] Look for code duplications (DRY violations)
- [ ] Detect functions/classes that are too long or complex
- [ ] Spot circular dependencies or tight couplings
- [ ] Verify consistency of patterns used

**Tools**:
```bash
# Complexity analysis
radon cc coffee_maker/ -a -nb

# Duplication detection
pylint coffee_maker/ --disable=all --enable=duplicate-code

# Static analysis
mypy coffee_maker/
```

**Best Practice - Parallel Claude Instance for Deep Refactoring** ⚡ NEW:

For major refactoring work, consider using a **parallel Claude instance** dedicated to simplification:

```
User Workflow:
1. Main Claude instance: Works on feature implementation
2. Parallel Claude instance: Simultaneously simplifies and removes redundancies
3. Coordination: Merge simplification work before starting next priority

Benefits:
- ✅ Continuous code quality improvement
- ✅ No interruption to feature development
- ✅ Deeper analysis and more thorough refactoring
- ✅ Fresh perspective on code organization
- ✅ Parallel work = faster overall progress

Example:
- Instance A (this conversation): Planning PRIORITY 2 (Autonomous Daemon)
- Instance B (parallel): Simplifying codebase, removing redundancies
- Result: Clean foundation ready for autonomous daemon to work with
```

**Real-World Example: Sprint 1 Improvements** ⚡ ACTUAL WORK DONE:

Sprint 1 (completed 2025-01-09) demonstrates the type of refactoring opportunities to look for:

**1. Replace Manual Retry Logic with Centralized Utilities**:
```python
# BEFORE (18 lines, repeated pattern):
def set_api_limits(providers_fallback):
    def _run_with_api_limits(self, **kwargs):
        attempt = 0
        while attempt < 3:
            try:
                return self.invoke(**kwargs)
            except openai.error.RateLimitError as e:
                print("Rate limit reached, waiting before retrying...")
                time.sleep(2**attempt)  # exponential backoff
                attempt += 1
        return providers_fallback("openai", self, **kwargs)

# AFTER (cleaner, observable, 21 lines but better structure):
@with_retry(
    max_attempts=3,
    backoff_base=2.0,
    retriable_exceptions=(openai.error.RateLimitError,),
)
def _invoke_with_retry():
    return self.invoke(**kwargs)

try:
    return _invoke_with_retry()
except RetryExhausted as e:
    logger.warning(f"Rate limit retry exhausted: {e.original_error}")
    return providers_fallback("openai", self, **kwargs)
```

**Benefits**: Langfuse observability, proper logging, type safety, consistent with codebase

**2. Extract Duplicate Code to Reusable Utilities**:
```python
# BEFORE (9 lines repeated 3x = 27 lines total across cost_calculator.py):
now = time.time()
if timeframe == "day":
    threshold = now - 86400  # 24 hours
elif timeframe == "hour":
    threshold = now - 3600  # 1 hour
elif timeframe == "minute":
    threshold = now - 60  # 1 minute
else:  # "all"
    threshold = 0

# AFTER (1 line, reusable utility in time_utils.py):
threshold = get_timestamp_threshold(timeframe)

# New utility function:
def get_timestamp_threshold(
    timeframe: str,
    reference_time: Optional[float] = None,
) -> float:
    """Get Unix timestamp threshold for a timeframe.

    Args:
        timeframe: One of "minute", "hour", "day", or "all"
        reference_time: Reference Unix timestamp (default: current time)

    Returns:
        Unix timestamp threshold

    Raises:
        ValueError: If timeframe is invalid
    """
    # Implementation...
```

**Savings**: 27 lines → 3 lines (24 lines eliminated)

**3. Add Retry Protection to Flaky Database Operations**:
```python
# BEFORE (no retry protection, vulnerable to deadlocks/timeouts):
def get_llm_performance(self, days: int = 7, model: Optional[str] = None) -> Dict:
    """Get LLM performance metrics."""
    # Database query...

# AFTER (retry + observability):
@observe
@with_retry(
    max_attempts=3,
    backoff_base=1.5,
    retriable_exceptions=(OperationalError, TimeoutError),
)
def get_llm_performance(self, days: int = 7, model: Optional[str] = None) -> Dict:
    """Get LLM performance metrics."""
    # Same query, now resilient to transient failures
```

**Impact**: Added to 7 database query methods in analytics/analyzer.py
- Handles database deadlocks automatically
- Handles connection pool exhaustion
- All operations tracked in Langfuse

**4. Delete Deprecated Code**:
```python
# DELETED FILES (800 lines removed):
- coffee_maker/langchain_observe/_deprecated/auto_picker_llm.py (739 lines)
- coffee_maker/langchain_observe/_deprecated/create_auto_picker.py (61 lines)
- coffee_maker/langchain_observe/_deprecated/ (entire directory)
```

**Rationale**: Keeping deprecated code causes confusion and maintenance burden

**Sprint 1 Metrics**:
- ✅ **800+ lines removed** (deprecated code + duplication)
- ✅ **27 lines of duplication eliminated**
- ✅ **11 critical methods** now observable in Langfuse
- ✅ **10+ flaky operations** now have retry protection
- ✅ **15+ new type annotations** added
- ✅ **112 tests passing** (no regressions)

**Key Refactoring Opportunities to Look For**:
1. **Manual retry loops** → Replace with `@with_retry` decorator
2. **Duplicate calculations** → Extract to reusable utility functions
3. **Missing observability** → Add `@observe` decorator to critical methods
4. **Flaky database operations** → Add retry protection with proper exceptions
5. **Print statements** → Replace with proper logging (`logger.warning()`, etc.)
6. **Missing type hints** → Add type annotations for better IDE support
7. **Deprecated/dead code** → Delete unused files and functions
8. **Hard-coded values** → Extract to named constants
9. **Complex conditions** → Simplify with early returns and guard clauses
10. **Long functions** → Split into smaller, focused functions

**Documentation**: See `docs/sprint1_improvements_summary.md` for complete Sprint 1 report

#### 2. **Complexity Reduction** (1-3h)
- [ ] Extract long methods into smaller functions
- [ ] Simplify complex conditions (early returns, guard clauses)

**Validation Script**:
```bash
python scripts/validate_docs.py  # Create if doesn't exist
```

#### 4. **Tests and Coverage** (1-2h)
- [ ] Verify test coverage (target: > 80%)
- [ ] Add tests for missing edge cases
- [ ] Refactor duplicated tests
- [ ] Verify tests are readable and maintainable

**Commands**:
```bash
pytest --cov=coffee_maker --cov-report=html
coverage report --fail-under=80
```

#### 5. **Performance and Optimization** (1-2h - if relevant)
- [ ] Identify potential bottlenecks
- [ ] Check for unnecessary imports
- [ ] Optimize DB queries if applicable
- [ ] Check memory usage for high volumes

#### 6. **Cleanup** (30min-1h)
- [ ] Remove dead code (unused functions/classes)
- [ ] Clean unused imports
- [ ] Remove obsolete comments
- [ ] Format code (black, isort)
- [ ] Check TODOs and handle or document them

**Commands**:
```bash
# Automatic cleanup
black coffee_maker/
isort coffee_maker/
autoflake --remove-all-unused-imports --in-place --recursive coffee_maker/
```

#### 7. **Git Management and Versioning** (30min-1h)
- [ ] Create atomic and well-named commits
- [ ] Use feature branches for each subtask
- [ ] Make regular commits (at least daily)
- [ ] Write descriptive commit messages
- [ ] Create tags for important milestones

**Git Best Practices**:
```bash
# Branch naming convention
feature/analytics-exporter
feature/streamlit-dashboard
fix/rate-limiting-bug
refactor/simplify-fallback-strategy

# Commit message convention
# Format: <type>(<scope>): <description>
# Types: feat, fix, refactor, docs, test, chore, perf

git commit -m "feat(analytics): add Langfuse to SQLite exporter"
git commit -m "refactor(llm): reduce complexity of AutoPickerLLM"
git commit -m "docs(analytics): add usage examples to exporter"
git commit -m "test(analytics): add integration tests for exporter"

# Tags for milestones
git tag -a v1.0.0-analytics -m "Analytics & Observability completed"
git tag -a v1.1.0-streamlit-dashboard -m "Streamlit Analytics Dashboard completed"
```

**Recommended Git Workflow**:
1. **Project start**: Create feature branch
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/project-name
   ```

2. **During development**: Regular commits
   ```bash
   # Atomic commits per feature
   git add coffee_maker/analytics/exporter.py
   git commit -m "feat(analytics): implement basic exporter structure"

   git add tests/test_exporter.py
   git commit -m "test(analytics): add unit tests for exporter"
   ```

3. **End of subtask**: Push and potential PR (if team work)
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/project-name
   ```

4. **Continuous improvement**: Separate refactoring commits
   ```bash
   git commit -m "refactor(analytics): simplify exporter error handling"
   git commit -m "docs(analytics): add docstrings to exporter methods"
   git commit -m "test(analytics): improve test coverage to 85%"
   ```

5. **Project end**: Merge into main and tag
   ```bash
   git checkout main
   git merge feature/project-name
   git tag -a v1.x.0-project-name -m "Project completed description"
   git push origin main --tags
   ```

**Git Checklist Before Finalizing a Project**:
- [ ] All modified files are committed
- [ ] Commit messages are clear and descriptive
- [ ] Commits are atomic (1 commit = 1 feature/fix)
- [ ] Feature branch is merged into main
- [ ] Version tag is created
- [ ] CHANGELOG.md is updated (if applicable)
- [ ] Tests pass on main branch after merge

Follow the roadmap guidelines and deliverables.

Important:
- Follow all coding standards
- Add tests where appropriate
- Document your changes

Priority details:
$PRIORITY_CONTENT

Begin implementation now.
```

**Usage in Code**:
```python
from coffee_maker.autonomous.prompt_loader import load_prompt, PromptNames

prompt = load_prompt(
    PromptNames.IMPLEMENT_FEATURE,
    {
        "PRIORITY_NAME": "US-021",
        "PRIORITY_TITLE": "Refactoring",

```python
prompt = f"""Create a spec for {priority_name}..."""
```

**After Phase 1 (Centralized)**:
```python
prompt = load_prompt(PromptNames.CREATE_TECHNICAL_SPEC, {...})
```

**After Phase 2 (Langfuse)**:
```python
# Same API, but sources from Langfuse with local fallback
prompt = load_prompt(PromptNames.CREATE_TECHNICAL_SPEC, {...})

## US-033: Automatic User Story Detection in user_listener

**Status**: ✅ COMPLETE
**Type**: Agent Enhancement / User Experience
**Complexity**: Medium
**Priority**: High
**Created**: 2025-10-16

### User Story

> "As a user, I want the user_listener to automatically detect when I'm describing a user story, so that it's automatically delegated to project_manager to add to ROADMAP."

### Description

Enhance user_listener with intelligent user story detection capabilities. When a user describes a feature request in natural language (either formal "As a X I want Y so that Z" format or informal "I want to..." format), user_listener should:

1. Automatically detect the user story pattern
2. Extract key components (actor, goal, benefit)
3. Show a confirmation dialog with the extracted user story
4. Delegate to project_manager to add to ROADMAP when user confirms
5. Provide seamless UX without requiring explicit /US command

### Business Value

**Improved User Experience**: Users can describe features naturally without learning special commands or formats. The system understands intent and handles the mechanics of ROADMAP management automatically.

**Reduced Friction**: Eliminates the need to use explicit /US commands or know the exact user story format.

**Increased Adoption**: Makes the system more accessible to non-technical users who may not be familiar with agile user story syntax.

### Estimated Effort

2-3 days (16-24 hours)

### Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Detects formal user story format: "As a [actor] I want [goal] so that [benefit]"
- [ ] Detects informal formats: "I want to...", "We need...", "Can you add..."
- [ ] Uses AI (Claude/Gemini) for pattern detection with confidence scoring
- [ ] Triggers confirmation dialog when confidence > 70%
- [ ] Confirmation workflow offers: [y]es / [n]o / [e]dit options
- [ ] Successfully delegates to project_manager when user confirms
- [ ] project_manager adds to ROADMAP with next available US-XXX ID
- [ ] Works seamlessly in user_listener CLI interface
- [ ] Provides clear feedback about what was detected and what will happen
- [ ] Handles edge cases gracefully (ambiguous requests, false positives)
- [ ] Includes comprehensive test coverage (25+ tests)

### Technical Requirements

**Core Components**:

1. **UserStoryDetector Class** (`coffee_maker/cli/user_story_detector.py`):
   - Pattern matching for formal and informal user stories
   - AI-powered confidence scoring
   - Component extraction (actor, goal, benefit)
   - Support for multiple AI providers (Claude, Gemini, OpenAI)

2. **Integration with user_listener**:
   - Hook into message processing pipeline
   - Pre-process user input before standard classification
   - Show confirmation dialog when user story detected
   - Delegate to project_manager on confirmation

3. **Delegation Workflow**:
   - Extract user story components
   - Format as proper user story syntax
   - Call project_manager to add to ROADMAP
   - Return confirmation to user with US-XXX ID

4. **RequestClassifier Enhancement** (if needed):
   - Add `user_story` intent type
   - Integrate UserStoryDetector as preprocessing step
   - Maintain backward compatibility with existing intents

**User Experience Flow**:

```
User: "I want to add email notifications when a build fails"
     ↓
[UserStoryDetector detects user story with 85% confidence]
     ↓
user_listener: "I detected a user story:

    As a: Developer
    I want: Email notifications when a build fails
    So that: I can respond quickly to failures

    Would you like me to add this to the ROADMAP? [y/n/e]"
     ↓
User: "y"
     ↓
[Delegates to project_manager]
     ↓
user_listener: "✅ Added as US-034: Email Build Failure Notifications"
```

## US-034: Create architect Agent for Technical Specifications and Dependency Management

**Status**: ✅ COMPLETE (2025-10-16)
**Type**: Agent Creation / Architecture
**Complexity**: High
**Priority**: Critical
**Created**: 2025-10-16

### User Story

> "As a development team, I want an architect agent that creates technical specifications before implementation, so that we have architectural consistency, proper dependency management, and clear technical guidelines."

### Description

Create a new architect agent that serves as the technical design authority for the system. The architect agent will:

1. Create detailed technical specifications BEFORE code_developer implements features
2. Document architectural decisions in ADRs (Architectural Decision Records)
3. Manage dependencies with user approval (ONLY agent allowed to modify pyproject.toml)
4. Provide implementation guidelines for code_developer to follow
5. Ensure architectural consistency across the codebase
6. Proactively ask users for approval on important architectural decisions

The architect agent will be the bridge between strategic planning (project_manager) and implementation (code_developer), ensuring that technical decisions are well-documented and dependencies are managed safely.

### Business Value

**Architectural Consistency**: Prevents architectural drift by establishing clear patterns and guidelines before implementation begins.

**Safe Dependency Management**: Centralizes dependency decisions in one agent that requires user approval, preventing uncontrolled dependency bloat.

**Clear Technical Direction**: code_developer receives detailed specifications and guidelines, reducing ambiguity and implementation errors.

**Documentation Quality**: ADRs provide historical context for why technical decisions were made, helping future developers understand the system.

**Risk Reduction**: User approval for dependency changes prevents security vulnerabilities and licensing issues.

### Estimated Effort

2-3 days (16-24 hours)

### What architect Will Own

**Document Ownership**:
- `docs/architecture/` - All technical architecture documentation
  - `docs/architecture/specs/` - Technical specifications
  - `docs/architecture/decisions/` - ADRs (Architectural Decision Records)
  - `docs/architecture/guidelines/` - Implementation guidelines
- `pyproject.toml` - ONLY agent allowed to modify dependencies
- `poetry.lock` - Dependency lock file

**Responsibilities**:
1. Create technical specifications BEFORE implementation
2. Document architectural decisions in ADRs
3. Manage dependencies with user approval (ONLY agent that can run `poetry add`)
4. Provide detailed implementation guidelines for code_developer
5. Ensure architectural consistency across the codebase
6. Proactively ask user for approval on important decisions
7. Review code_developer implementations for architectural compliance (future)

### Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Implementation guideline template created (`docs/architecture/guidelines/GUIDELINE-template.md`)
- [ ] Dependency management workflow defined (requires user approval)
- [ ] Integration with code_developer (architect creates specs → code_developer implements)
- [ ] Integration with user_listener (user requests go through user_listener UI)
- [ ] Documentation in CLAUDE.md updated to reflect architect ownership
- [ ] File ownership matrix updated in DOCUMENT_OWNERSHIP_MATRIX.md
- [ ] Comprehensive test coverage for architect workflows
- [ ] Example ADR created demonstrating the format

     - Status (Proposed, Accepted, Deprecated, Superseded)
     - Date and author information
   - **Technical Spec Template**: Detailed implementation specifications
     - Problem statement, proposed solution, technical details
     - API definitions, data structures, algorithms
     - Testing strategy, rollout plan
   - **Implementation Guideline Template**: Code patterns and best practices
     - When to use, how to implement, anti-patterns to avoid
     - Code examples, testing approach

3. **Directory Structure**:
   ```
   docs/architecture/
   ├── decisions/
   │   ├── ADR-000-template.md
   │   ├── ADR-001-use-mixins-pattern.md
   │   └── ADR-002-centralize-prompts.md
   ├── specs/
   │   ├── SPEC-template.md
   │   └── SPEC-001-architect-agent.md
   └── guidelines/
       ├── GUIDELINE-template.md
       └── GUIDELINE-001-error-handling.md
   ```

4. **Integration with code_developer**:
   - architect creates specs in `docs/architecture/specs/`
   - code_developer reads specs before implementation
   - code_developer follows guidelines from `docs/architecture/guidelines/`
   - code_developer references ADRs for context

5. **Dependency Management Workflow**:
   - ONLY architect can modify `pyproject.toml`
   - architect MUST request user approval before adding dependencies
   - User approval workflow:
     1. architect identifies need for new dependency
     2. architect creates proposal with justification
     3. architect requests approval from user via user_listener
     4. User approves/denies via user_listener UI
     5. If approved, architect runs `poetry add <package>`
     6. architect documents decision in ADR

### Architect Workflow Examples

**Example 1: Creating Technical Specification**

```
User (via user_listener): "Design the architecture for the new caching layer"
     ↓
user_listener delegates to architect
     ↓
architect:
1. Analyzes requirements
2. Creates SPEC-003-caching-layer.md in docs/architecture/specs/
3. Defines:
   - Cache storage mechanism (Redis vs in-memory)
   - Cache invalidation strategy
   - API design
   - Performance requirements
   - Testing strategy
4. Returns spec location to user_listener
     ↓
user_listener presents to user: "Specification created at docs/architecture/specs/SPEC-003-caching-layer.md"
     ↓
User reviews and approves
     ↓
user_listener delegates to code_developer: "Implement SPEC-003"
     ↓
code_developer reads spec and implements
```

**Example 2: Managing Dependencies**

```
code_developer (internal thought): "I need the 'redis' package for caching"
     ↓
code_developer CANNOT modify pyproject.toml (not allowed)
     ↓
code_developer delegates to architect: "Need redis package for caching implementation"
     ↓
architect:
1. Evaluates dependency (security, licensing, maintenance)
2. Creates proposal with justification
3. Requests approval from user via user_listener
     ↓
user_listener presents to user: "architect requests permission to add 'redis' package:
- Purpose: Caching layer implementation
- License: BSD-3-Clause (compatible)
- Last updated: 2025-09 (actively maintained)
- Security: No known vulnerabilities
- Alternatives considered: in-memory cache (rejected: doesn't persist), memcached (rejected: less feature-rich)

Approve? [y/n]"
     ↓
User: "y"
     ↓
architect runs: poetry add redis
architect creates: ADR-005-use-redis-for-caching.md
architect notifies code_developer: "redis package added, proceed with implementation"
```

**Example 3: Creating ADR**

```
architect (internal or user-triggered): "Document decision to use mixins pattern"
     ↓
architect creates ADR-001-use-mixins-pattern.md:

# ADR-001: Use Mixins Pattern for Daemon Composition

**Status**: Accepted
**Date**: 2025-10-16
**Author**: architect agent

## Context
The daemon.py file was becoming monolithic with multiple responsibilities.

## Decision
Use mixins pattern to compose daemon functionality.

## Consequences
**Positive**:
- Better separation of concerns
- Easier testing of individual components
- More maintainable codebase

**Negative**:
- Slightly more complex file structure
- Need to understand composition pattern

## Alternatives Considered
1. Inheritance hierarchy - Rejected: too rigid
2. Separate service classes - Rejected: adds boilerplate
```

### Testing Strategy

**Unit Tests** (10+ tests):
- Test ADR creation
- Test technical spec creation
- Test dependency evaluation
- Test approval workflow
- Test integration with code_developer
- Test integration with user_listener

**Integration Tests** (8+ tests):
- Test end-to-end spec creation workflow
- Test dependency addition workflow
- Test architect → code_developer handoff
- Test user approval workflow

**Manual Testing**:
- Create real ADR for existing decision
- Create real technical spec for future feature
- Test dependency addition with user approval
- Verify ownership boundaries are respected

### Dependencies

- user_listener agent (for user interactions)
- code_developer agent (for implementation)
- project_manager agent (for strategic coordination)
- DOCUMENT_OWNERSHIP_MATRIX.md (for ownership rules)
- CLAUDE.md (for system documentation)

### Success Metrics

- **Specification Quality**: Technical specs are clear and actionable
- **ADR Usefulness**: Future developers reference ADRs for context
- **Dependency Safety**: Zero unauthorized dependency additions
- **User Approval Rate**: >90% approval rate for dependency requests
- **Implementation Clarity**: code_developer requires <5% clarification requests
- **Architectural Consistency**: Code reviews show consistent patterns

### Ownership Boundaries

**architect OWNS**:
- `docs/architecture/` (all subdirectories)
- `pyproject.toml` (dependency management only)
- `poetry.lock` (managed via poetry commands)
- Technical specifications for features
- Architectural Decision Records (ADRs)
- Implementation guidelines

**architect DOES NOT OWN**:
- `docs/roadmap/` (project_manager owns)
- `docs/PRIORITY_*_TECHNICAL_SPEC.md` (project_manager owns - strategic specs)
- `.claude/` (code_developer owns - technical configuration)
- `coffee_maker/` (code_developer owns - implementation)
- User interface (user_listener owns)

**architect INTERACTS WITH**:
- **user_listener**: Receives architectural requests, sends approval requests
- **code_developer**: Provides specs and guidelines, receives implementation questions
- **project_manager**: Coordinates on feature planning, distinguishes strategic vs technical specs

### Future Enhancements

1. **Automated Compliance Checking**: architect reviews PRs for architectural compliance
2. **Pattern Library**: Maintain reusable architectural patterns
3. **Dependency Scanning**: Automated security and license checks
4. **Architecture Diagrams**: Generate visual architecture documentation
5. **Refactoring Recommendations**: Proactively suggest architectural improvements
6. **API Design Tools**: Specialized tools for API specification
7. **Performance Modeling**: Model performance implications of architectural decisions

### Notes

- architect is a **technical authority**, not a strategic planner
- architect **requires user approval** for dependency changes (safety-critical)
- architect **creates specifications**, code_developer **implements** them
- architect **interacts through user_listener** (no direct UI access)
- architect **documents decisions**, providing historical context for future work
- architect focuses on **HOW** (technical), project_manager focuses on **WHAT** (strategic)

## US-035: Implement Singleton Agent Enforcement

**Status**: 📝 PLANNED (CRITICAL - Architectural Requirement)
**Type**: Architecture / Safety
**Complexity**: Medium
**Priority**: CRITICAL
**Created**: 2025-10-16

### User Story

> "As a system architect, I want to enforce that each agent type can only have ONE running instance at a time, so that we prevent resource conflicts, duplicate work, and ensure consistent state."

### Description

Implement singleton enforcement for all agents to prevent multiple instances of the same agent type from running simultaneously. This is a fundamental architectural requirement that was identified as missing during system analysis.

**Critical Context**: This US implements part of CFR-000 (Prevent File Conflicts).

**Singleton Rule**:
- Agents that OWN files: MUST be singleton (prevent same-agent conflicts)
- Agents that own NO files: Can have multiple instances (safe - no conflicts)

**File-Owning Agents** (MUST be singleton):
- code_developer (owns .claude/, coffee_maker/, tests/)
- project_manager (owns docs/roadmap/)
- architect (owns docs/architecture/)
- generator (owns docs/generator/)
- reflector (owns docs/reflector/)
- curator (owns docs/curator/)

**Non-File-Owning Agents** (multiple instances OK):
- assistant (READ-ONLY, only reads and delegates)
- user_listener (delegation-only, no writes)
- code-searcher (READ-ONLY, only analyzes)
- ux-design-expert (provides specs, doesn't write)

**Exception Logic**:
```python
if agent.owns_files():
    enforce_singleton()  # Prevent file conflicts
else:
    allow_multiple_instances()  # Safe, no file ownership
```

**Why This Is Critical**:
- Multiple instances could conflict (writing same files simultaneously)
- Duplicate work wastes resources and causes race conditions
- Inconsistent state between instances leads to bugs
- File corruption risk when multiple agents write to same files
- This is a fundamental architectural requirement that must be enforced

Without singleton enforcement, we risk:
- Two code_developer instances editing the same file
- Multiple project_manager instances updating ROADMAP simultaneously
- Race conditions in status tracking and notifications
- Resource exhaustion from duplicate agent processes

### Business Value

**System Stability**: Prevents serious bugs caused by concurrent agent instances writing to the same resources.

**Data Integrity**: Ensures consistent state across the system by preventing concurrent modifications.

**Resource Efficiency**: Eliminates wasted resources from duplicate agent work.

**Architectural Soundness**: Enforces a fundamental design principle that should have been in place from the start.

### Estimated Effort

2-3 days (6-8 hours)

### Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Create `AgentRegistry` singleton class in `coffee_maker/autonomous/ace/agent_registry.py`
- [ ] Registry tracks all running agent instances by type
- [ ] Attempting to create duplicate agent raises `AgentAlreadyRunningError` with clear message
- [ ] Add `@singleton` decorator for agent classes
- [ ] Test singleton enforcement in `tests/unit/test_ace_singleton_agents.py` (20+ tests)
- [ ] Document requirement in `docs/AGENT_SINGLETON_ARCHITECTURE.md`
- [ ] Update `.claude/CLAUDE.md` with singleton requirement
- [ ] Update all agent classes to use singleton pattern:
  - [ ] code_developer
  - [ ] project_manager
  - [ ] user_listener
  - [ ] architect
  - [ ] assistant
  - [ ] code-searcher
  - [ ] ux-design-expert
  - [ ] generator
  - [ ] reflector
  - [ ] curator
- [ ] Add cleanup on agent shutdown (remove from registry)
- [ ] Handle edge cases (crashed agents, stale registrations)
- [ ] Thread-safe implementation with locks
- [ ] Clear error messages when duplicate detected

### Technical Design

**AgentRegistry Class**:
```python
# coffee_maker/autonomous/ace/agent_registry.py

from typing import Dict, Type, Optional
import threading
from datetime import datetime

class AgentAlreadyRunningError(Exception):
    """Raised when attempting to create a duplicate agent instance."""
    pass

class AgentRegistry:
    """Singleton registry tracking all running agent instances."""

    _instance = None
    _lock = threading.Lock()

    def __init__(self):
        self._agents: Dict[str, tuple[object, datetime]] = {}
        self._registry_lock = threading.Lock()

    @classmethod
    def get_instance(cls) -> 'AgentRegistry':
        if cls._instance is None:
            with cls._lock:
                if cls._instance is None:
                    cls._instance = cls()
        return cls._instance

    def register_agent(self, agent_type: str, instance: object):
        """Register an agent instance. Raises if duplicate exists."""
        with self._registry_lock:
            if agent_type in self._agents:
                existing_instance, registered_at = self._agents[agent_type]
                raise AgentAlreadyRunningError(
                    f"Agent '{agent_type}' is already running "
                    f"(registered at {registered_at}). "
                    f"Only one instance per agent type is allowed."
                )
            self._agents[agent_type] = (instance, datetime.now())

    def unregister_agent(self, agent_type: str):
        """Unregister an agent instance."""
        with self._registry_lock:
            self._agents.pop(agent_type, None)

    def is_registered(self, agent_type: str) -> bool:
        """Check if an agent type is registered."""
        with self._registry_lock:
            return agent_type in self._agents

    def get_registered_agents(self) -> Dict[str, datetime]:
        """Get all registered agent types and their registration times."""
        with self._registry_lock:
            return {
                agent_type: registered_at
                for agent_type, (_, registered_at) in self._agents.items()
            }

    def cleanup_stale_agents(self, max_age_minutes: int = 60):
        """Remove agents registered longer than max_age_minutes."""
        with self._registry_lock:
            now = datetime.now()
            stale_agents = [
                agent_type
                for agent_type, (_, registered_at) in self._agents.items()
                if (now - registered_at).total_seconds() > max_age_minutes * 60
            ]
            for agent_type in stale_agents:
                self._agents.pop(agent_type)
            return stale_agents
```

**Singleton Decorator**:
```python
def singleton(agent_type: str):
    """Decorator to enforce singleton pattern for agent classes."""
    def decorator(cls):
        original_init = cls.__init__

        def new_init(self, *args, **kwargs):
            registry = AgentRegistry.get_instance()
            registry.register_agent(agent_type, self)
            try:
                original_init(self, *args, **kwargs)
            except Exception:
                registry.unregister_agent(agent_type)
                raise

        cls.__init__ = new_init

        # Add cleanup on delete
        original_del = getattr(cls, '__del__', None)

        def new_del(self):
            registry = AgentRegistry.get_instance()
            registry.unregister_agent(agent_type)
            if original_del:
                original_del(self)

        cls.__del__ = new_del

        return cls

    return decorator
```

**Usage Example**:
```python
from coffee_maker.autonomous.ace.agent_registry import singleton

@singleton("code_developer")
class CodeDeveloper:
    def __init__(self):
        # If another CodeDeveloper instance exists,
        # AgentAlreadyRunningError is raised here
        pass

# First instance succeeds
dev1 = CodeDeveloper()

# Second instance fails with clear error
try:
    dev2 = CodeDeveloper()  # Raises AgentAlreadyRunningError
except AgentAlreadyRunningError as e:
    print(e)  # "Agent 'code_developer' is already running..."
```

### Implementation Plan

**Phase 1: Core Registry (3 hours)**:
- Create `AgentRegistry` class
- Implement singleton pattern for registry
- Thread-safe registration/unregistration
- Stale agent cleanup logic

**Phase 2: Decorator & Integration (2 hours)**:
- Create `@singleton` decorator
- Add to all agent classes
- Implement cleanup on agent shutdown
- Error handling for edge cases

**Phase 3: Testing (2 hours)**:
- Unit tests for `AgentRegistry` (15+ tests)
- Test singleton enforcement
- Test thread safety
- Test cleanup logic
- Test error messages

**Phase 4: Documentation (1 hour)**:
- Create `docs/AGENT_SINGLETON_ARCHITECTURE.md`
- Update `.claude/CLAUDE.md`
- Document usage patterns
- Add troubleshooting guide

### Files to Create/Modify

**New Files**:
- `coffee_maker/autonomous/ace/agent_registry.py` - AgentRegistry singleton
- `tests/unit/test_ace_singleton_agents.py` - Comprehensive tests (20+ tests)
- `docs/AGENT_SINGLETON_ARCHITECTURE.md` - Architecture documentation

**Modified Files**:
- `.claude/CLAUDE.md` - Add singleton requirement to architecture section
- `coffee_maker/autonomous/daemon.py` - Add @singleton decorator
- `coffee_maker/cli/user_listener.py` - Add @singleton decorator
- `coffee_maker/autonomous/agents/architect.py` - Add @singleton decorator
- `coffee_maker/autonomous/ace/generator.py` - Add @singleton decorator
- `coffee_maker/autonomous/ace/reflector.py` - Add @singleton decorator
- `coffee_maker/autonomous/ace/curator.py` - Add @singleton decorator
- All other agent files - Add @singleton decorator

### Testing Strategy

**Unit Tests** (20+ tests in `test_ace_singleton_agents.py`):
- Test AgentRegistry singleton pattern
- Test agent registration success
- Test duplicate registration failure
- Test agent unregistration
- Test cleanup on agent shutdown
- Test stale agent cleanup
- Test thread safety (concurrent registrations)
- Test error messages are clear
- Test edge cases (crashed agents, null instances)
- Test multiple agent types don't conflict
- Test registry state after cleanup

**Integration Tests** (5+ tests):
- Test agent lifecycle with singleton enforcement
- Test daemon startup with singleton agents
- Test agent restart after crash
- Test cleanup on process exit

**Manual Testing**:
- Attempt to start two code_developer instances manually
- Verify clear error message
- Test agent restart after clean shutdown
- Test agent cleanup after crash

### Dependencies

- All agent classes (to add @singleton decorator)
- Threading library (for locks)
- Datetime library (for stale agent tracking)

### Success Metrics

- **Zero Duplicate Instances**: No agent can have multiple running instances
- **Clear Error Messages**: Users understand why duplicate creation failed
- **No False Positives**: Legitimate agent restarts work correctly
- **Thread Safety**: Concurrent agent operations don't cause race conditions
- **Stale Cleanup**: Crashed agents don't permanently block new instances

### Edge Cases to Handle

1. **Crashed Agent**: Agent crashes without cleanup → Stale cleanup handles it
2. **Process Kill**: Process killed hard → Registry cleared on process restart
3. **Concurrent Creation**: Two threads try to create same agent → First wins, second fails
4. **Agent Restart**: Agent cleanly exits and restarts → Unregister then register succeeds
5. **Stale Registry**: Agent registered but process is dead → Cleanup based on age

### Future Enhancements

1. **Distributed Registry**: Support agents across multiple processes/machines
2. **Health Checks**: Ping agents to verify they're still alive
3. **Automatic Recovery**: Detect crashed agents and restart them
4. **Metrics**: Track agent uptime, restart frequency, failure rates
5. **Audit Log**: Track all agent registrations/unregistrations

### Notes

- This is a **critical architectural gap** that was missed initially
- Should be implemented BEFORE adding more features
- Prevents serious bugs that could corrupt data
- Relatively low effort for high value (critical safety feature)
- Thread-safe implementation is essential
- Clear error messages help debugging

## US-038: Implement File Ownership Enforcement in generator Agent

**Status**: 📝 PLANNED - AWAITING ARCHITECT TECHNICAL SPEC
**Type**: Architecture / Safety / ACE Framework
**Complexity**: High
**Priority**: CRITICAL
**Created**: 2025-10-16
**Depends On**: US-035 (Singleton enforcement must be complete first)

**IMPORTANT - Ownership Violation Detected**:
- ❌ docs/US_038_TECHNICAL_SPEC.md was created by project_manager (VIOLATION!)
- ✅ CORRECT: architect creates technical specs in docs/architecture/user_stories/
- 🔄 Action Required: architect needs to review and migrate this technical spec

**Delegation Flow** (Strategic → Technical → Implementation):
1. **project_manager (strategic)**: Defines WHAT and WHY (this ROADMAP entry)
2. **architect (technical design)**: Creates HOW in docs/architecture/user_stories/US_038_TECHNICAL_SPEC.md
3. **code_developer (implementation)**: Implements based on architect's technical spec

### User Story

> "As the ACE framework orchestrator, I want the generator agent to enforce file ownership rules automatically, so that agents cannot violate ownership boundaries and all file operations are properly delegated to the correct owner."

### Description

Enhance the generator agent to act as the central enforcement point for file ownership rules. Since generator ALWAYS intercepts all agent actions as part of the ACE framework, it's the perfect place to check ownership and automatically delegate operations to the correct owner when violations are detected.

**Critical Context**: This US implements part of CFR-000 (Prevent File Conflicts).

generator enforces file ownership to prevent two different agents from writing to the same file simultaneously.

**Integration with US-035**:
- US-035 prevents multiple instances of same agent (same-agent conflicts)
- US-038 prevents different agents writing same file (cross-agent conflicts)
- Together: Complete file conflict prevention

**Why This Is Critical**:
- Prevents agents from accidentally modifying files they don't own
- Centralizes enforcement at the orchestration layer (generator)
- Automatic delegation instead of just blocking violations
- Provides learning opportunity for reflector (delegation traces)
- Enforces architectural boundaries systematically

**Current State**:
- File ownership rules documented in CLAUDE.md
- Agents manually respect ownership (honor system)
- No automated enforcement
- Violations can slip through code review
- No automatic delegation when violations occur

**Target State**:
- generator checks ownership before EVERY file operation
- Automatic delegation to correct owner when violation detected
- Traces capture ownership checks and delegations
- Reflector learns from delegation patterns
- Zero ownership violations reach execution

### Workflow

```
Agent attempts file operation →
  generator intercepts action →
    generator checks FileOwnership registry →
      If agent OWNS file:
        Execute action directly
        Capture success trace
      If agent does NOT own file:
        Auto-delegate to correct owner
        Capture delegation trace
        Return delegated result
```

### Example Scenario

```
project_manager tries to modify .claude/CLAUDE.md →
  generator intercepts Edit tool call →
    generator checks ownership:
      .claude/ owned by code_developer (NOT project_manager)
    generator auto-delegates:
      "Delegating to code_developer (owns .claude/)"
    code_developer modifies .claude/CLAUDE.md →
    generator captures delegation trace →
      reflector learns: "project_manager often needs code_developer for .claude/ changes"
    generator returns success to project_manager
```

### Business Value

**Architectural Integrity**: Enforces ownership boundaries automatically, preventing corruption and conflicts.

**Developer Productivity**: Automatic delegation means agents don't need to manually check ownership.

**Learning Opportunity**: Delegation traces help reflector identify common patterns and improve agent collaboration.

**Error Prevention**: Blocks violations before they cause file corruption or merge conflicts.

### Estimated Effort

2-3 days (8-10 hours)

### Acceptance Criteria

**Core Implementation**:
- [ ] Create `FileOwnership` registry in `coffee_maker/autonomous/ace/file_ownership.py`
- [ ] Registry maps file patterns to agent owners (based on DOCUMENT_OWNERSHIP_MATRIX.md)
- [ ] generator intercepts ALL file operations (Edit, Write, NotebookEdit tools)
- [ ] Pre-action ownership check in generator before executing operations
- [ ] Auto-delegation logic when ownership violation detected
- [ ] Delegation trace capture for reflector analysis

**File Tool Implementation**:
- [ ] Create WriteTool class with ownership enforcement
- [ ] Create ReadTool class (unrestricted)
- [ ] Centralized FILE_TOOL_OWNERSHIP configuration (file_tool_config.py)

### Technical Design

**1. FileOwnership Registry**:
```python
class FileOwnership:
    """Registry mapping files/directories to agent owners."""

    OWNERSHIP_RULES = {
        # Directories
        ".claude/**": AgentType.CODE_DEVELOPER,
        "docs/roadmap/**": AgentType.PROJECT_MANAGER,
        "docs/architecture/**": AgentType.ARCHITECT,
        "coffee_maker/**": AgentType.CODE_DEVELOPER,
        "tests/**": AgentType.CODE_DEVELOPER,

        # Special cases
        "pyproject.toml": AgentType.ARCHITECT,
        "poetry.lock": AgentType.ARCHITECT,
    }

    @classmethod
    def get_owner(cls, file_path: str) -> AgentType:
        """Return the agent that owns this file."""
        # Match file_path against OWNERSHIP_RULES patterns
        # Return matching owner or raise OwnershipUnclearError
```

**2. generator Ownership Check**:
```python
class Generator:
    def intercept_action(self, agent: AgentType, action: ToolCall):
        """Intercept and validate all agent actions."""

        if action.tool in ["Edit", "Write", "NotebookEdit"]:
            file_path = action.parameters["file_path"]
            owner = FileOwnership.get_owner(file_path)

            if owner != agent:
                # Ownership violation - auto-delegate
                return self.delegate_to_owner(
                    violating_agent=agent,
                    correct_owner=owner,
                    action=action,
                    file_path=file_path
                )

        # Ownership OK or non-file operation - execute
        return self.execute_action(agent, action)
```

**3. Auto-Delegation**:
```python
def delegate_to_owner(self, violating_agent, correct_owner, action, file_path):
    """Delegate file operation to correct owner."""

    # Log delegation
    logger.info(f"Delegating {action.tool} on {file_path} "
                f"from {violating_agent} to {correct_owner}")

    # Execute via correct owner
    result = self.execute_as_agent(correct_owner, action)

    # Capture delegation trace for reflector
    trace = DelegationTrace(
        timestamp=now(),
        violating_agent=violating_agent,
        correct_owner=correct_owner,
        file_path=file_path,
        operation=action.tool,
        result=result.status,
        reason="ownership_enforcement"
    )
    self.save_trace(trace)

    return result
```

**4. Trace Capture**:
- All ownership checks recorded in execution traces
- Delegation events flagged for reflector analysis
- Traces include: agent, file, owner, action, result, timestamp
- reflector can identify delegation patterns over time

### Implementation Plan

**Phase 1: FileOwnership Registry (2 hours)**:
- Create `file_ownership.py` module
- Implement ownership rule matching with glob patterns
- Add all ownership mappings from DOCUMENT_OWNERSHIP_MATRIX.md
- Write unit tests for ownership lookup
- Handle edge cases and unclear ownership

**Phase 2: generator Integration (3 hours)**:
- Add ownership checking to generator's action interception
- Implement pre-action validation for file operations
- Add delegation logic when violations detected
- Test with mock agents and file operations

**Phase 3: Auto-Delegation Mechanism (2 hours)**:
- Implement delegation protocol between agents
- Handle delegation context passing
- Return results from delegated operations
- Error handling when delegation fails

**Phase 4: Trace Capture (1 hour)**:
- Extend trace format for delegation events
- Capture ownership check results
- Store delegation metadata for reflector
- Test trace capture and storage

**Phase 5: Testing & Documentation (2 hours)**:
- Write comprehensive test suite (20+ scenarios)
- Test all ownership patterns from matrix
- Test delegation for each agent type
- Create technical specification document
- Update agent definitions and collaboration docs

### Files to Create/Modify

**New Files**:
- `coffee_maker/autonomous/ace/file_ownership.py` - Ownership registry (code_developer creates)
- `docs/US_038_TECHNICAL_SPEC.md` - Technical specification (project_manager creates)
- `tests/unit/test_file_ownership_enforcement.py` - Test suite (code_developer creates)

**Modified Files** (code_developer modifies):
- `coffee_maker/autonomous/ace/generator.py` - Add ownership enforcement
- `.claude/agents/generator.md` - Update agent definition with enforcement role
- `.claude/CLAUDE.md` - Update Tool Ownership Matrix

**Modified Files** (project_manager modifies):
- `docs/roadmap/TEAM_COLLABORATION.md` - Document generator's enforcement role
- `docs/ROADMAP.md` - This user story

### Testing Strategy

**Unit Tests** (20+ scenarios):
```python
def test_ownership_check_code_developer_files():
    """Test code_developer owns .claude/ files."""
    assert FileOwnership.get_owner(".claude/CLAUDE.md") == AgentType.CODE_DEVELOPER

def test_ownership_check_project_manager_files():
    """Test project_manager owns docs/roadmap/ files."""
    assert FileOwnership.get_owner("docs/roadmap/ROADMAP.md") == AgentType.PROJECT_MANAGER

def test_auto_delegation_on_violation():
    """Test generator auto-delegates when ownership violated."""
    # project_manager tries to edit .claude/CLAUDE.md
    # generator should delegate to code_developer
    # Verify delegation trace captured

def test_delegation_trace_capture():
    """Test delegation events recorded in traces."""
    # Trigger delegation
    # Verify trace contains: violating agent, owner, file, operation
```

**Integration Tests**:
- Real agent interactions with ownership enforcement
- Test all ownership patterns from matrix
- Verify auto-delegation works end-to-end
- Check reflector can analyze delegation traces

### Success Metrics

- **Zero Ownership Violations**: No file operations execute with wrong owner
- **100% Delegation Success**: All violations properly delegated
- **Trace Quality**: All delegations captured with complete metadata
- **Performance**: <50ms overhead per file operation
- **Coverage**: >95% test coverage for ownership enforcement

### Dependencies

**Requires US-035 Complete**:
- Singleton enforcement must be in place first
- Prevents multiple agent instances complicating delegation
- US-035 provides AgentRegistry that US-038 needs

**Blocks Future Work**:
- Safe parallel agent execution (no ownership conflicts)
- Advanced delegation strategies (learned from traces)
- Automated agent collaboration improvements

### Risks & Mitigation

**Risk 1: Delegation Complexity**:
- **Mitigation**: Start with simple delegation (direct tool call forwarding)
- **Mitigation**: Add context passing in Phase 2 if needed

**Risk 2: Performance Overhead**:
- **Mitigation**: Cache ownership lookups
- **Mitigation**: Only check file operations (not all actions)

**Risk 3: Circular Delegation**:
- **Mitigation**: Track delegation chain depth, limit to 1 level initially
- **Mitigation**: Detect and prevent circular references

**Risk 4: Unclear Ownership**:
- **Mitigation**: Explicit error messages when ownership ambiguous
- **Mitigation**: Fallback to user confirmation if needed

### Notes

- **generator is ideal enforcement point**: Already intercepts ALL actions
- **Automatic delegation is key**: Not just blocking, but fixing violations
- **Learning opportunity**: reflector can identify delegation patterns
- **Clean separation**: Enforcement in orchestration layer (generator)
- **This completes ownership architecture**: US-035 (singleton) + US-038 (ownership)
- **Code_developer will implement**: project_manager creates spec, code_developer implements
- **Critical for multi-agent safety**: Prevents file corruption and conflicts

## US-039: Implement Critical Functional Requirements (CFR) Enforcement System

**Status**: 📝 PLANNED - CRITICAL SYSTEM REQUIREMENT
**Type**: Architecture / Safety / System Integrity
**Complexity**: High
**Priority**: CRITICAL (Same level as US-035, US-038)
**Created**: 2025-10-16
**Depends On**: US-038 (File ownership enforcement provides foundation)
**Related**: US-035 (Singleton enforcement), US-038 (Ownership enforcement)

**IMPORTANT - System Invariants**:
- These are CRITICAL system rules that MUST be enforced at ALL times
- Violations are NOT ALLOWED
- When detected, system must STOP, EXPOSE problem to user, PROVIDE safe alternatives
- See: docs/roadmap/CRITICAL_FUNCTIONAL_REQUIREMENTS.md for complete documentation

**Delegation Flow** (Strategic → Technical → Implementation):
1. **project_manager (strategic)**: Defines WHAT and WHY (this ROADMAP entry + CRITICAL_FUNCTIONAL_REQUIREMENTS.md)
2. **architect (technical design)**: Creates HOW in docs/architecture/user_stories/US_039_TECHNICAL_SPEC.md
3. **code_developer (implementation)**: Implements based on architect's technical spec

### User Story

> "As the system orchestrator, I want all agents to enforce Critical Functional Requirements (CFRs) before ANY action, so that the system never violates its own ownership/role boundaries and always exposes violations to users with safe alternatives."

### Description

Implement comprehensive enforcement of Critical Functional Requirements (CFRs) at ALL levels of the system. CFRs are system invariants that define:
- Prevent file conflicts at all costs (CFR-000 - MASTER REQUIREMENT)
- Document ownership boundaries (CFR-001)
- Agent role boundaries (CFR-002)
- No overlaps in owned documents (CFR-003)
- No overlaps in agent responsibilities (CFR-004)

**Critical Context**: This US implements comprehensive enforcement of CFR-000 (Prevent File Conflicts).

Provides multiple validation levels to catch any scenario that could lead to file conflicts:
- Level 2: Validates user stories won't create conflict opportunities
- Level 3: Validates user requests won't violate conflict prevention
- Level 4: Agent self-check before work to prevent conflicts

**Integration**:
- US-035: Singleton enforcement (same-agent conflict prevention)
- US-038: Ownership enforcement (cross-agent conflict prevention)
- US-039: Comprehensive validation (catches all other scenarios)
- Together: Complete CFR-000 implementation

**Why This Is Critical**:
- Prevents system from breaking itself through boundary violations
- Enforces architectural integrity at all decision points
- Exposes problems to users BEFORE violations occur
- Provides safe alternatives instead of just blocking
- Creates learning opportunities from violation patterns
- **CRITICAL**: US-040 failure demonstrates need - project_manager created CFR-violating user story that user had to catch (see docs/roadmap/learnings/WORKFLOW_FAILURE_US_040.md)

**Current State**:
- US-038 provides Level 1 enforcement (generator auto-delegation for file operations)
- CFRs documented in CRITICAL_FUNCTIONAL_REQUIREMENTS.md
- No validation at user story creation time
- No validation at user request time
- No validation at agent decision time
- Violations can be proposed and require manual detection

**Target State**:
- Level 1: generator enforces ownership (US-038) ✅
- Level 2: User story validation before ROADMAP addition
- Level 3: User request validation before execution
- Level 4: Agent self-check before planning work
- All levels expose violations to users with safe alternatives
- Comprehensive test coverage for all CFR enforcement paths

### Workflow

```
User makes request →
  Level 3: User request validation →
    Check if request violates CFRs →
      If NO violations:
        Proceed with delegation
      If violations detected:
        STOP action
        Expose problem to user
        Provide safe alternatives
        Wait for user decision

Agent plans work →
  Level 4: Agent self-check →
    Check ownership matrix (CFR-001)
    Check role matrix (CFR-002)
      If agent OWNS files AND has appropriate ROLE:
        Proceed with work
      If violations:
        Delegate to correct agent instead

User story creation →
  Level 2: User story validation →
    Parse user story requirements
    Check against CFR-001 (ownership)
    Check against CFR-002 (roles)
    Check against CFR-003 (no document overlap)
    Check against CFR-004 (no role overlap)
      If violations:
        STOP user story creation
        Expose problem to user
        Suggest corrected version
        Wait for user approval
```

### Example Scenarios

**Scenario 1: User Story Violation Prevention**:
```
User proposes: "US-040: project_manager refactors CLI code"

Level 2 validation detects:
  - Violation 1: coffee_maker/ owned by code_developer (CFR-001)
  - Violation 2: Implementation is code_developer's role (CFR-002)

System response:
  "⚠️ USER STORY VIOLATION DETECTED

  US-040 proposes: project_manager refactors CLI code

  Violations:
  1. CFR-001: coffee_maker/ owned by code_developer
  2. CFR-002: Implementation is code_developer's role

  Safe Alternatives:
  Option 1: project_manager defines requirements
            → architect designs refactoring
            → code_developer implements

  Option 2: Rewrite US-040 to assign work correctly

  Which approach do you prefer?"

Result: Violation prevented BEFORE user story added to ROADMAP
```

**Scenario 2: User Request Violation Prevention**:
```
User to assistant: "Implement the new authentication feature"

Level 3 validation detects:
  - assistant's role: Demos + Documentation + Dispatch
  - Required action: Implementation (code_developer's role)
  - Violation: assistant cannot implement code (CFR-002)

assistant response:
  "I can't implement code directly (CFR-002: Role Boundaries).
   I'll delegate to code_developer who handles implementation.

   Would you like me to:
   1. Delegate to code_developer to implement
   2. Have project_manager create strategic spec first
   3. Show you the current authentication system"

Result: Violation prevented, user educated, correct delegation offered
```

**Scenario 3: Agent Self-Check Delegation**:
```
assistant analyzes codebase and finds critical security bug

Level 4 self-check:
  - assistant checks: Can I add to ROADMAP?
  - CFR-001: docs/roadmap/ owned by project_manager
  - CFR-002: assistant's role is Demos + Documentation + Dispatch
  - Decision: Delegate to project_manager instead

assistant action:
  - Prepares comprehensive bug report
  - Delegates to project_manager
  - project_manager adds critical priority to ROADMAP

Result: Ownership respected, work completed correctly
```

### Business Value

**System Integrity**: Prevents system from violating its own architectural boundaries.

**User Transparency**: All violations exposed to users with clear explanations and alternatives.

**Learning Opportunity**: Violation patterns analyzed to improve agent coordination.

**Developer Confidence**: System cannot break itself through ownership/role confusion.

### Estimated Effort

3-4 days (12-16 hours)

### Acceptance Criteria

**Core Implementation**:
- [ ] Create CFR validation module in `coffee_maker/autonomous/ace/cfr_validator.py`
- [ ] Implement Level 2: User story validation before ROADMAP addition
- [ ] Implement Level 3: User request validation before execution
- [ ] Implement Level 4: Agent self-check before work planning
- [ ] CFR violation detection for all 4 CFRs (001-004)
- [ ] User notification system for violation exposure
- [ ] Safe alternative suggestion system
- [ ] Implement task delegation tool for agent-to-agent coordination
- [ ] Implement complexity escalation workflow (Agent → project_manager → architect → user)

**Task Delegation Tool**:
- [ ] Create `delegate_task(task_description, context)` function in `coffee_maker/autonomous/ace/delegation_tool.py`
- [ ] Integration with generator for centralized routing
- [ ] Automatic CFR checking before delegation
- [ ] Delegation trace capture for reflector analysis
- [ ] Support for context passing between agents
- [ ] Transparent result passing back to requesting agent
- [ ] All agents have access to delegation tool

**Complexity Escalation Workflow**:
- [ ] Agent-level escalation: Detect when task violates CFRs
- [ ] project_manager strategic simplification: Analyze complexity, provide guidance
- [ ] architect technical simplification: Create specs/guidelines when needed
- [ ] User escalation: Present options when neither PM nor architect can resolve
- [ ] Escalation message format enforcement (standardized template)
- [ ] Escalation tracking and logging for learning
- [ ] Integration with warn_user() for critical escalations
- [ ] Documentation of escalation patterns and resolutions

**Level 2: User Story Validation (ENHANCED - Based on US-040 Failure)**:
- [ ] **Mandatory CFR Check**: project_manager MUST read CRITICAL_FUNCTIONAL_REQUIREMENTS.md BEFORE creating any user story
- [ ] **Validate against ALL CFRs**: Check US against CFR-000, CFR-001, CFR-002, CFR-003, CFR-004, CFR-005
  - [ ] CFR-000: Will this US create file conflict opportunities?
  - [ ] CFR-001: Do assigned agents OWN target files?
  - [ ] CFR-002: Does work match assigned agents' PRIMARY ROLES?
  - [ ] CFR-003: Any ownership overlaps proposed?
  - [ ] CFR-004: Any role overlaps proposed?
  - [ ] CFR-005: Is maintenance responsibility clear?
- [ ] **User Acting as Agent Detection**: Detect if US proposes "user edits [agent-owned files]"
  - If detected: BLOCK with message: "User cannot assume agent ownership. Suggest delegation approach."
- [ ] **Parse user story** requirements to identify involved agents and files
- [ ] **If ANY doubt exists**: STOP immediately, escalate to architect for technical review
- [ ] **If CFR violation detected**:
  - [ ] BLOCK user story creation immediately
  - [ ] Generate clear violation message with CFR number and explanation
  - [ ] Provide 2-3 CFR-compatible alternatives with concrete examples
  - [ ] Show architectural reasoning for why violation cannot work
  - [ ] Wait for user decision
- [ ] **ONLY if CFR-compatible**: Add to ROADMAP and proceed with delegation
- [ ] **Document validation**: Log all validation checks and results for reflector analysis
- [ ] **Example failure case**: US-040 should have been blocked (see docs/roadmap/learnings/WORKFLOW_FAILURE_US_040.md)

**Lessons Integration** (CFR-006):
- [ ] Read docs/roadmap/learnings/ before validation
- [ ] Check against known failure patterns
- [ ] Reference specific lessons in error messages
- [ ] Log new failures for lesson capture
- [ ] Trigger lesson capture on validation failures (delegate to project_manager)
- [ ] Example: Reference WORKFLOW_FAILURE_US_040.md when blocking similar patterns

**Level 3: User Request Validation**:
- [ ] Analyze user request intent
- [ ] Identify required actions and agents
- [ ] Check against all CFR rules (001-006)
- [ ] Expose violations with clear explanations
- [ ] Offer safe alternatives (delegation paths)
- [ ] Wait for user decision

**Level 4: Agent Self-Check**:
- [ ] Agents verify file ownership before planning work
- [ ] Agents verify role appropriateness before planning work
- [ ] Automatic delegation to correct agent if violations detected
- [ ] Integration with existing agent workflows

**Integration**:
- [ ] Update user_listener to use Level 3 validation on all user requests
- [ ] Update project_manager to use Level 2 validation on user story creation
- [ ] Update all agents to use Level 4 self-check before work
- [ ] Update generator to reference CFR enforcement (builds on US-038)
- [ ] Update TEAM_COLLABORATION.md with CFR enforcement workflows
- [ ] Update CLAUDE.md with CFR references

**User Notification System**:
- [ ] Create `warn_user()` function for CFR violations
- [ ] Include violation type, involved files/agents, CFR number
- [ ] Provide 2-3 safe alternatives
- [ ] Link to CRITICAL_FUNCTIONAL_REQUIREMENTS.md for details
- [ ] Priority levels: critical (blockers), high (important), normal (recommendations)

**Testing**:
- [ ] Create comprehensive test suite `tests/unit/test_cfr_enforcement.py`
- [ ] Test Level 2 validation (user story scenarios)
- [ ] Test Level 3 validation (user request scenarios)
- [ ] Test Level 4 validation (agent self-check scenarios)
- [ ] Test all 4 CFRs (CFR-001 through CFR-004)
- [ ] Test safe alternative generation
- [ ] Test user notification system
- [ ] Integration tests with real agents (30+ scenarios)
- [ ] Test violation patterns from CRITICAL_FUNCTIONAL_REQUIREMENTS.md examples

### Technical Design (High-Level)

**1. CFR Validator Module**:
```python
class CFRValidator:
    """Validates actions against Critical Functional Requirements."""

    @classmethod
    def validate_user_story(cls, user_story: dict) -> ValidationResult:
        """Level 2: Validate user story before ROADMAP addition."""
        violations = []

        # Check CFR-001: Document ownership
        for file in user_story.get("files", []):
            owner = FileOwnership.get_owner(file)
            assigned_agent = user_story.get("agent")
            if owner != assigned_agent:
                violations.append(
                    CFRViolation(
                        cfr="CFR-001",
                        type="ownership",
                        file=file,
                        expected_owner=owner,
                        assigned_agent=assigned_agent
                    )
                )

        # Check CFR-002: Role boundaries
        required_role = infer_role_from_work(user_story.get("description"))
        assigned_agent = user_story.get("agent")
        if not RoleMatrix.agent_has_role(assigned_agent, required_role):
            violations.append(
                CFRViolation(
                    cfr="CFR-002",
                    type="role_boundary",
                    required_role=required_role,
                    assigned_agent=assigned_agent
                )
            )

        # Check CFR-003 & CFR-004: No overlaps
        # (Implementation details in technical spec)

        if violations:
            alternatives = SafeAlternativeGenerator.generate(violations, user_story)
            return ValidationResult(
                passed=False,
                violations=violations,
                alternatives=alternatives
            )

        return ValidationResult(passed=True)

    @classmethod
    def validate_user_request(cls, request: str, agent: AgentType) -> ValidationResult:
        """Level 3: Validate user request before execution."""
        # Parse request to identify required actions
        # Check against CFRs
        # Return validation result with alternatives

    @classmethod
    def agent_self_check(cls, agent: AgentType, planned_work: dict) -> ValidationResult:
        """Level 4: Agent validates work before planning."""
        # Check if agent owns target files (CFR-001)
        # Check if work matches agent's role (CFR-002)
        # Return validation result (delegate if violations)
```

**2. Safe Alternative Generator**:
```python
class SafeAlternativeGenerator:
    """Generates safe alternatives when CFR violations detected."""

    @classmethod
    def generate(cls, violations: list[CFRViolation], context: dict) -> list[Alternative]:
        """Generate 2-3 safe alternatives that respect CFRs."""

        alternatives = []

        if has_ownership_violation(violations):
            # Alternative 1: Delegate to correct owner
            alternatives.append(
                Alternative(
                    description="Auto-delegate to correct owner",
                    workflow=generate_delegation_workflow(violations),
                    recommended=True
                )
            )

        if has_role_violation(violations):
            # Alternative 2: Multi-agent workflow
            alternatives.append(
                Alternative(
                    description="Decompose into multi-agent workflow",
                    workflow=generate_multi_agent_workflow(violations, context),
                    recommended=True
                )
            )

        # Alternative 3: Review CFRs
        alternatives.append(
            Alternative(
                description="Review ownership matrix and CFRs",
                action="show_cfr_documentation",
                recommended=False
            )
        )

        return alternatives
```

**3. User Notification for CFR Violations**:
```python
def warn_user_about_cfr_violation(violations: list[CFRViolation], alternatives: list[Alternative]):
    """Expose CFR violation to user with safe alternatives."""

    message = format_violation_message(violations)
    message += "\n\nSafe Alternatives:\n"

    for i, alt in enumerate(alternatives, 1):
        message += f"{i}. {alt.description}\n"
        if alt.workflow:
            message += f"   {format_workflow(alt.workflow)}\n"

    message += f"\nReview CFRs: docs/roadmap/CRITICAL_FUNCTIONAL_REQUIREMENTS.md"

    service = AIService()
    service.warn_user(
        title=f"⚠️ CFR VIOLATION: {violations[0].cfr}",
        message=message,
        priority="critical" if is_blocking(violations) else "high",
        context={"violations": [v.to_dict() for v in violations]}
    )
```

### Files to Create/Modify

**New Files**:
- `coffee_maker/autonomous/ace/cfr_validator.py` - CFR validation module (code_developer creates)
- `coffee_maker/autonomous/ace/safe_alternatives.py` - Alternative generator (code_developer creates)
- `tests/unit/test_cfr_enforcement.py` - Test suite (code_developer creates)
- `docs/architecture/user_stories/US_039_TECHNICAL_SPEC.md` - Technical spec (architect creates)

**Modified Files** (code_developer modifies):
- `coffee_maker/autonomous/agents/project_manager.py` - Add Level 2 validation
- `coffee_maker/autonomous/agents/user_listener.py` - Add Level 3 validation
- `coffee_maker/autonomous/agents/base_agent.py` - Add Level 4 self-check (if needed)
- `coffee_maker/cli/ai_service.py` - Enhance `warn_user()` for CFR violations

**Modified Files** (project_manager modifies):
- `docs/roadmap/TEAM_COLLABORATION.md` - Document CFR enforcement workflows
- `docs/roadmap/CRITICAL_FUNCTIONAL_REQUIREMENTS.md` - Already created ✅
- `docs/roadmap/ROADMAP.md` - This user story

### Testing Strategy

**Unit Tests** (30+ scenarios):
```python
def test_cfr_001_ownership_violation_detection():
    """Test CFR-001 detects ownership violations in user stories."""
    user_story = {
        "description": "project_manager modifies .claude/CLAUDE.md",
        "files": [".claude/CLAUDE.md"],
        "agent": "project_manager"
    }
    result = CFRValidator.validate_user_story(user_story)
    assert not result.passed
    assert result.violations[0].cfr == "CFR-001"
    assert result.alternatives  # Safe alternatives provided

def test_cfr_002_role_violation_detection():
    """Test CFR-002 detects role boundary violations."""
    user_story = {
        "description": "assistant implements new feature",
        "agent": "assistant",
        "work_type": "implementation"
    }
    result = CFRValidator.validate_user_story(user_story)
    assert not result.passed
    assert result.violations[0].cfr == "CFR-002"

def test_safe_alternatives_generated():
    """Test safe alternatives generated for violations."""
    violations = [ownership_violation, role_violation]
    alternatives = SafeAlternativeGenerator.generate(violations, context)
    assert len(alternatives) >= 2
    assert any(alt.recommended for alt in alternatives)

def test_level_2_user_story_validation():
    """Test Level 2: User story validated before ROADMAP addition."""
    # Test with violating user story
    # Verify validation stops creation
    # Verify alternatives presented to user

def test_level_3_user_request_validation():
    """Test Level 3: User request validated before execution."""
    # Test with violating request
    # Verify validation stops execution
    # Verify user educated about boundaries

def test_level_4_agent_self_check():
    """Test Level 4: Agent self-check before work."""
    # Test agent planning work outside its role
    # Verify self-check detects violation
    # Verify automatic delegation to correct agent
```

**Integration Tests**:
- Real user stories with CFR violations
- Real user requests with boundary issues
- Real agent workflows with ownership conflicts
- Verify all 4 enforcement levels work together
- Verify safe alternatives are actionable

### Success Metrics

- **Zero Undetected Violations**: All CFR violations caught before execution
- **100% User Exposure**: All violations exposed to users with clear explanations
- **Alternatives Quality**: 95%+ of alternatives are actionable and respect boundaries
- **User Understanding**: Users can make informed decisions about violations
- **System Integrity**: No boundary violations reach execution across all levels
- **Coverage**: >95% test coverage for CFR enforcement

### Dependencies

**Requires US-038 Complete**:
- US-038 provides Level 1 enforcement (generator auto-delegation)
- US-039 builds on this foundation with Levels 2-4
- FileOwnership registry from US-038 used by CFR validator

**Enhances**:
- US-035 (Singleton enforcement)
- US-038 (File ownership enforcement)

**Blocks Future Work**:
- Advanced multi-agent coordination (requires CFR enforcement)
- Automated workflow optimization (requires violation pattern analysis)

### Risks & Mitigation

**Risk 1: False Positives (Over-Detection)**:
- **Mitigation**: Comprehensive test suite with real scenarios
- **Mitigation**: User can override if needed (with warning)
- **Mitigation**: Improve detection based on feedback

**Risk 2: Complex Validation Logic**:
- **Mitigation**: Start simple (exact matches), add complexity gradually
- **Mitigation**: Extensive unit tests for edge cases
- **Mitigation**: Clear documentation of validation rules

**Risk 3: User Fatigue from Warnings**:
- **Mitigation**: Only warn on actual violations (not potential issues)
- **Mitigation**: Provide quick resolution (recommended alternative)
- **Mitigation**: Learn from patterns to reduce future violations

**Risk 4: Integration Complexity**:
- **Mitigation**: Phased rollout (Level 2 → Level 3 → Level 4)
- **Mitigation**: Integration tests at each phase
- **Mitigation**: Feature flags to disable levels if needed

### Notes

- **Completes CFR architecture**: US-035 (singleton) + US-038 (ownership) + US-039 (comprehensive enforcement)
- **System invariants**: These rules prevent system from breaking itself
- **User transparency**: All violations exposed, not hidden
- **Safe alternatives**: System always provides actionable paths
- **Learning opportunity**: Violation patterns help improve agent coordination
- **Critical for multi-agent systems**: Prevents chaos from boundary confusion
- **Foundation for autonomous operation**: Agents can safely delegate without violating boundaries

## US-041: Implement architect Agent as Operational Subagent

**Status**: ✅ COMPLETE (2025-10-16)
**Type**: Infrastructure / Agent Implementation
**Complexity**: Medium
**Priority**: VERY HIGH (blocks critical workflow)
**Created**: 2025-10-16
**Completed**: 2025-10-16
**Actual Effort**: 2 hours

**Delegation Flow** (Strategic → Technical → Implementation):
1. **project_manager (strategic)**: ✅ Defined WHAT and WHY (this ROADMAP entry)
2. **architect (technical design)**: ✅ NOW OPERATIONAL (registered in .claude/agents/README.md)
3. **code_developer (implementation)**: ✅ Implemented registration in .claude/agents/README.md

### User Story

> "As a system, I need architect to be a fully operational agent in the Task tool, so that architect can create technical specifications before code_developer implements features."

### Description

**CRITICAL ISSUE DISCOVERED**: architect agent exists as documentation (`.claude/agents/architect.md`, 659 lines) but is NOT registered as an operational subagent in the system.

**Current Situation**:
- architect documentation exists and is comprehensive
- architect directories exist (docs/architecture/)
- architect role is well-defined in CLAUDE.md
- US-034 marked as COMPLETE (created architect documentation)
- BUT: architect is NOT available in Task tool
- Error message: "Agent type 'architect' not found"
- Available agents: general-purpose, assistant, code-searcher, project_manager, code_developer, etc.
- architect is MISSING from this list

**Impact**:
- US-038, US-039 are BLOCKED waiting for architect technical specs
- Cannot create technical designs before implementation
- Violates proper workflow: architect designs → code_developer implements
- Strategic specs exist but no technical specs can be created

**Why This Is VERY HIGH PRIORITY**:
- Multiple user stories are blocked
- Current workflow violates architectural best practices (code_developer implementing without technical specs)
- System is incomplete - documentation exists but agent is not operational
- US-034 was prematurely marked as COMPLETE (only documentation created, not agent registration)

### Workflow Example (Once Fixed)

**Desired Workflow** (after US-041 complete):
```
1. User requests feature via user_listener
2. user_listener delegates to project_manager (strategic spec)
3. project_manager creates ROADMAP entry (strategic)
4. project_manager delegates to architect (technical spec)
5. architect creates docs/architecture/specs/US_XXX_TECHNICAL_SPEC.md (BLOCKED NOW)
6. architect delegates to code_developer (implementation)
7. code_developer implements based on architect's spec
```

**Current Broken Workflow** (US-041 not complete):
```
1. User requests feature via user_listener
2. user_listener delegates to project_manager (strategic spec)
3. project_manager creates ROADMAP entry (strategic)
4. project_manager tries to delegate to architect → ERROR: "Agent type 'architect' not found"
5. code_developer implements without technical spec (bad practice)
```

### Requirements

**Functional Requirements**:

1. **Agent Registration**:
   - Register architect as available subagent type in Task tool
   - architect appears in list of available agents
   - Can invoke: `Task(subagent_type="architect", prompt="...")`
   - architect shows up in help/documentation

2. **Agent Configuration**:
   - architect reads `.claude/agents/architect.md` for role definition
   - architect has access to all project documentation (READ-ONLY)
   - architect can write ONLY to owned directories:
     - docs/architecture/specs/
     - docs/architecture/decisions/
     - docs/architecture/guidelines/
     - pyproject.toml (with user approval)
     - poetry.lock

3. **Tool Configuration**:
   - WriteTool configured for architect:
     - docs/architecture/** (full write access)
     - pyproject.toml (requires user approval workflow)
     - poetry.lock (automatic via poetry commands)
   - ReadTool unrestricted (architect needs to read entire codebase for design)
   - Task tool available (architect can delegate to code_developer)

4. **Integration with ACE Framework**:
   - generator can route tasks to architect
   - architect actions captured in execution traces
   - reflector can analyze architect decisions
   - curator learns from architect patterns

5. **Ownership Enforcement** (US-038 Phase 1 already implemented):
   - FileOwnership registry recognizes architect
   - architect appears in ownership matrix
   - architect cannot modify files outside owned directories
   - System prevents violations

6. **Capabilities After Implementation**:
   - Create technical specifications in docs/architecture/specs/
   - Create ADRs in docs/architecture/decisions/
   - Create implementation guidelines in docs/architecture/guidelines/
   - Review and approve dependency changes (pyproject.toml, poetry.lock)
   - Provide technical guidance when escalated from project_manager
   - Delegate to code_developer after specs are complete

- FileOwnership enforcement (US-038 Phase 1)

**Unblocks**:
- US-038 Phase 2: architect can create technical spec for file ownership implementation
- US-039 Phase 2: architect can create technical spec for CFR enforcement
- All future user stories requiring technical specifications

### Success Metrics

- **Agent Availability**: architect appears in available agents list
- **Successful Invocations**: Can invoke architect via Task tool (0 errors)
- **Spec Creation**: architect can create technical specifications in docs/architecture/specs/
- **Delegation Success**: project_manager → architect → code_developer workflow works
- **Ownership Enforcement**: architect cannot violate file ownership boundaries
- **Unblock Downstream**: US-038, US-039 can proceed with technical specs

### Notes

**Why US-034 Was Prematurely Marked Complete**:
- US-034 created excellent documentation (659 lines in `.claude/agents/architect.md`)
- US-034 created directory structure (docs/architecture/)
- US-034 created templates (ADR, spec, guideline templates)
- BUT: US-034 did NOT register architect as operational subagent
- This is a critical gap that blocks the entire workflow

**US-041 vs US-034**:
- US-034: Create architect DOCUMENTATION (✅ COMPLETE)
- US-041: Make architect OPERATIONAL (📝 NOT COMPLETE - THIS US)

**Relationship to US-038**:
- US-038 Phase 1: FileOwnership includes architect (✅ COMPLETE)
- US-041: architect becomes operational (this US)
- US-038 Phase 2: architect creates technical spec for ownership implementation (BLOCKED on US-041)

**Priority Justification**:
- VERY HIGH PRIORITY because:
  - Blocks US-038, US-039 (all high-priority work)
  - Current workflow violates best practices
  - Quick to implement (mostly configuration)
  - High impact (unblocks entire team)

## US-045: Fix Daemon to Delegate Spec Creation to architect (CRITICAL)

**Status**: 📝 PLANNED - 🚨 CRITICAL BLOCKING PRIORITY
**Type**: Architectural Debt / Integration Fix
**Complexity**: Medium
**Priority**: CRITICAL (blocks ALL daemon work)
**Created**: 2025-10-16
**Estimated Effort**: 6-8 hours

**Delegation Flow** (Strategic → Technical → Implementation):
1. **project_manager (strategic)**: ✅ Defined WHAT and WHY (this ROADMAP entry)
2. **architect (technical design)**: Will create technical spec for daemon-architect integration
3. **code_developer (implementation)**: Will implement daemon delegation to architect

### User Story

> "As a daemon, I need to delegate technical spec creation to the architect agent instead of using direct Claude CLI calls, so that I can progress past PRIORITY 9 and follow proper architectural ownership boundaries."

### Description

**CRITICAL ISSUE DISCOVERED**: The code_developer daemon is stuck in an infinite loop trying to create technical specifications for PRIORITY 9. It times out after 10 minutes on every iteration.

**Root Cause**:
- `daemon_spec_manager.py` (lines 103-127) uses `self.claude.execute_prompt()` to create specs directly
- This code was written before architect became operational (pre-US-041)
- According to architecture ownership matrix (CLAUDE.md), **architect** should create technical specifications
- Daemon should delegate to architect agent, not execute Claude CLI directly

**Current Broken Workflow**:
```
Iteration N:
1. Daemon finds PRIORITY 9 needs technical spec
2. daemon_spec_manager._ensure_technical_spec() called
3. Builds prompt using load_prompt(PromptNames.CREATE_TECHNICAL_SPEC)
4. Calls self.claude.execute_prompt(spec_prompt, timeout=600)
5. Claude CLI executes for 10 minutes
6. Times out or completes without creating file
7. ERROR: "Claude completed but spec file was not created"
8. Daemon skips PRIORITY 9, waits 30 seconds
9. Repeats iteration N+1 (infinite loop)
```

**Desired Workflow** (after US-045):
```
Iteration N:
1. Daemon finds PRIORITY 9 needs technical spec
2. daemon_spec_manager._ensure_technical_spec() called
3. Delegates to architect: "Create technical spec for PRIORITY 9"
4. architect analyzes requirements from ROADMAP.md
5. architect creates docs/architecture/specs/SPEC-009-enhanced-communication.md
6. architect returns spec location to daemon
7. Daemon reads technical spec
8. Daemon proceeds with implementation of PRIORITY 9
```

**Impact**:
- **Blocking**: Daemon cannot progress past PRIORITY 9
- **Infinite Loop**: Daemon stuck repeating same failed operation
- **Resource Waste**: 10-minute timeouts consume time and API quota
- **Architecture Violation**: daemon bypasses architect ownership boundaries
- **User Experience**: Appears broken/stuck to users

### Requirements

**Functional Requirements**:

1. **Remove Direct Claude CLI Calls from Spec Creation**:
   - Remove `self.claude.execute_prompt()` from `daemon_spec_manager.py`
   - Daemon should NOT create specs itself
   - All spec creation must go through architect

2. **Implement Delegation to architect**:
   - Use proper agent delegation mechanism (Task tool or equivalent)
   - Pass priority information to architect
   - Receive spec location from architect
   - Handle architect failures gracefully

3. **Update Spec Location Strategy**:
   - **Current**: daemon creates `docs/PRIORITY_X_TECHNICAL_SPEC.md` (strategic spec location)
   - **New**: architect creates `docs/architecture/specs/SPEC-XXX-feature-name.md` (technical spec location)
   - Daemon must look in correct location after architect creates spec

4. **Error Handling**:
   - If architect unavailable: Daemon BLOCKS and notifies user (do NOT fall back to direct Claude)
   - If architect fails: Daemon logs error, notifies user, moves to next priority
   - No silent failures, no infinite loops

5. **Fallback Strategy**:
   - **NO fallback to old direct-Claude approach** (prevents regression)
   - If architect fails, daemon should notify user and BLOCK
   - This ensures architect issues are caught early

### Acceptance Criteria

**Delegation Working**:
- [ ] `daemon_spec_manager._ensure_technical_spec()` delegates to architect
- [ ] No direct `self.claude.execute_prompt()` calls in spec creation flow
- [ ] architect receives priority info and creates spec in `docs/architecture/specs/`
- [ ] Daemon successfully reads architect-created spec

**PRIORITY 9 Unblocked**:
- [ ] Daemon processes PRIORITY 9 without timeouts
- [ ] Technical spec created in correct location
- [ ] Daemon moves to implementation phase
- [ ] No "Claude completed but spec file was not created" errors

**Error Handling**:
- [ ] architect failures logged clearly
- [ ] User notified when architect unavailable
- [ ] Daemon does NOT enter infinite loops on failures
- [ ] Graceful degradation (skip priority, notify user)

**Testing**:
- [ ] Unit tests for daemon-architect delegation
- [ ] Integration test: Full workflow from PRIORITY detection → spec creation → implementation
- [ ] Test error cases (architect unavailable, architect fails, timeout)
- [ ] All existing daemon tests still pass

**Documentation**:
- [ ] Update `daemon_spec_manager.py` docstrings
- [ ] Document new delegation workflow in comments
- [ ] Update relevant ADRs (if needed)
- [ ] Update CLAUDE.md if workflow changes significantly

### Implementation Plan

**Phase 1: Design** (1-2 hours):
- [ ] architect creates technical spec for daemon-architect integration
- [ ] Define delegation interface
- [ ] Define spec location mapping (PRIORITY X → SPEC-XXX-name.md)
- [ ] Design error handling strategy

**Phase 2: Implementation** (3-4 hours):
- [ ] Update `daemon_spec_manager._ensure_technical_spec()`:
  - Remove `self.claude.execute_prompt()` call
  - Add delegation to architect
  - Update spec path logic (look in docs/architecture/specs/)
- [ ] Add error handling for architect failures
- [ ] Add logging and user notifications
- [ ] Update related methods if needed

**Phase 3: Testing** (1-2 hours):
- [ ] Unit tests for delegation mechanism
- [ ] Integration test with real PRIORITY 9
- [ ] Test error cases
- [ ] Verify all existing tests pass

**Phase 4: Verification** (1 hour):
- [ ] Restart daemon, verify PRIORITY 9 processed successfully
- [ ] Check no timeouts or infinite loops
- [ ] Verify spec created in correct location
- [ ] Monitor for any issues

### Dependencies

**Completed**:
- ✅ US-041: architect operational (architect registered in .claude/agents/README.md)
- ✅ architect can be invoked via Task tool
- ✅ architect has write access to docs/architecture/specs/

**Required**:
- architect agent fully operational
- Task tool or equivalent delegation mechanism
- daemon has access to invoke agents

**Unblocks**:
- PRIORITY 9: Enhanced code_developer Communication & Daily Standup
- All future PRIORITYs requiring technical specs
- Daemon autonomous operation resumes

### Success Metrics

- **Daemon Progress**: Daemon successfully processes PRIORITY 9
- **No Timeouts**: Zero 10-minute timeout errors
- **No Infinite Loops**: Daemon progresses through priorities
- **Spec Creation**: architect creates specs in correct location
- **Architecture Compliance**: Daemon respects architect ownership boundaries

### Notes

**Why This Is CRITICAL**:
- Daemon is completely blocked (cannot progress)
- Infinite loop wastes resources
- Violates architectural ownership boundaries
- Quick to fix (6-8 hours) with high impact

**Relationship to Other US**:
- **US-041**: Made architect operational (✅ COMPLETE)
- **US-045**: Integrates daemon with architect (this US - BLOCKING)
- **PRIORITY 9**: Blocked by daemon-architect integration issue

**Historical Context**:
- daemon_spec_manager.py written before architect was operational
- Architectural debt accumulated as system evolved
- Now that architect exists, daemon must be updated to use it

### US-042: Implement Context-Upfront File Access Pattern

**Status**: ✅ COMPLETE - HIGH PRIORITY (Performance & Clarity)

**Created**: 2025-10-16

**Estimated Effort**: 1 day

**Completed**: 2025-10-16

**Actual Effort**: ~3 hours

**User Story**:
As a system designer, I want agents to receive required files upfront in their context, so they don't waste time searching for files during execution, improving performance and clarity.

**Problem Statement**:
Currently, agents use Glob/Grep to search for files during execution. This is:
- **Wasteful**: Searching when they should KNOW which files to read
- **Confusing**: Why is the agent searching?
- **Inefficient**: Adds latency to agent operations
- **Unclear**: File requirements not documented

code-searcher exists specifically for file discovery. Other agents should have their context specified upfront.

**Description**:
Ensure agents receive required files upfront, eliminating wasteful file searching during execution. Each agent's role definition should specify "Required Files (Context)" that are provided at invocation time.

**Requirements**:

1. **Agent Role Definitions Updated**:
   - All `.claude/agents/*.md` include "Required Files (Context)" section
   - Clear specification of which files agent needs
   - Explanation of WHY each file is needed
   - Exceptions documented (code-searcher, architect for analysis)

2. **generator Context Provision**:
   - generator loads context files before routing to agents
   - Context files included in agent prompts
   - Reduced need for agents to search

3. **Agents Use Read for Known Paths**:
   - Agents use Read tool for known file paths
   - Glob/Grep only for:
     - code-searcher (discovery is the role)
     - architect (analyzing codebase patterns)
     - Exceptional cases (documented)

4. **File Searching Delegated to code-searcher**:
   - "Find all files that..." → code-searcher
   - "Where is X implemented?" → code-searcher
   - Discovery tasks → code-searcher

5. **Logging & Monitoring**:
   - generator logs when agents unexpectedly search
   - Reflection traces: "Agent searched - should context be clearer?"
   - Performance metrics: reduced Glob/Grep calls

6. **Documentation Updated**:
   - CRITICAL_FUNCTIONAL_REQUIREMENTS.md includes "Agent File Access Patterns"
   - Each agent's .md includes "Required Files (Context)"
   - CLAUDE.md references context-upfront principle

**Acceptance Criteria**:

- [x] All `.claude/agents/*.md` have "Required Files (Context)" section
- [x] generator provides context files when routing to agents
- [x] Agents receive context in prompts (not searching)
- [x] Agents use Read for known paths (not Glob/Grep)
- [x] code-searcher handles discovery tasks (delegated)
- [x] Performance metrics show reduced searching (baseline vs after)
- [x] Documentation updated (CFRs, agent definitions, CLAUDE.md)
- [x] Logging captures unexpected file searches
- [x] Tests verify context provision works
- [x] All agents follow pattern consistently


**Implementation Summary**:

✅ **All Deliverables Complete**:

1. **Agent Definitions Updated** (6 agents):
   - code_developer.md: Core context + technical specs
   - project_manager.md: Strategic docs + team collaboration
   - architect.md: Design docs + ADRs + dependencies
   - assistant.md: Documentation expertise + prompts index
   - code-searcher.md: Exception - discovery is role
   - ux-design-expert.md: Design standards + feature requirements

2. **Generator Context Loading** (coffee_maker/autonomous/ace/generator.py):
   - load_agent_context(): Load required files per agent
   - format_context_for_prompt(): Format for inclusion in prompts
   - AGENT_CONTEXT_FILES: Mapping of agents to required files
   - Handles missing files gracefully (error messages)

3. **Search Monitoring** (coffee_maker/autonomous/ace/generator.py):
   - monitor_file_search(): Track unexpected searches
   - _log_search_trace(): Record traces for reflector
   - get_search_stats(): Statistics on searches
   - code-searcher exempt (expected to search)
   - architect allowed (for codebase analysis)

4. **Comprehensive Tests** (tests/unit/test_context_upfront.py):
   - 21 tests covering all functionality
   - 100% passing (all green)
   - TestContextLoading: All 6 agents
   - TestContextFormatting: Prompt formatting
   - TestSearchMonitoring: Unexpected searches
   - TestSearchStatistics: Performance metrics
   - TestIntegration: Full workflows
   - TestErrorHandling: Edge cases

**Performance Impact**:

- **Expected**: 80%+ reduction in Glob/Grep calls
- **Benefit**: Faster agent execution, clearer intent
- **Monitoring**: Search stats track unexpected searches

**Key Design Decisions**:

1. **code-searcher is Exception**: Discovery IS the role
2. **architect May Search**: For codebase analysis when designing
3. **Context Truncation**: Max 5000 chars per file in prompts (configurable)
4. **Graceful Degradation**: Missing files return error messages (not failures)
5. **Monitoring, Not Blocking**: Log unexpected searches, don't prevent them

**Files Modified**:
- .claude/agents/code_developer.md
- .claude/agents/project_manager.md
- .claude/agents/architect.md
- .claude/agents/assistant.md
- .claude/agents/code-searcher.md
- .claude/agents/ux-design-expert.md
- coffee_maker/autonomous/ace/generator.py
- docs/roadmap/ROADMAP.md

**Files Created**:
- tests/unit/test_context_upfront.py

**Next Steps**:
- Monitor search stats in production to identify patterns
- Add more context files if unexpected searches detected
- Consider dynamic context loading based on task type

**Technical Details**:

**Required Files by Agent**:

```markdown
code_developer:
  Always Read: ROADMAP.md, CLAUDE.md, code_developer.md
  When Implementing: PRIORITY_*_STRATEGIC_SPEC.md, SPEC-*-*.md, GUIDELINE-*.md
  Never Search: (except understanding existing code)

project_manager:
  Always Read: ROADMAP.md, TEAM_COLLABORATION.md, CRITICAL_FUNCTIONAL_REQUIREMENTS.md, CLAUDE.md
  Never Search: (for strategic work)

architect:
  Always Read: ROADMAP.md, CLAUDE.md, ADR-*.md (skim), PRIORITY_*_STRATEGIC_SPEC.md
  May Search: (for codebase analysis when designing)

assistant:
  Always Read: ROADMAP.md, CLAUDE.md, assistant.md
  May Search: (delegates to code-searcher for deep analysis, uses Grep/Read for 1-2 files)

code-searcher:
  Always Read: None (discovery is the role)
  Primary Tool: Glob, Grep, Read
```

**Implementation Approach**:

```python
# generator routes to agent with context
def route_to_agent(agent_type, task):
    # Load required files based on agent type
    context_files = load_context_files(agent_type)

    # Include in prompt
    prompt = f"""
    You are {agent_type}.

    Context files loaded:
    {context_files}

    Task: {task}
    """

    return execute_agent(agent_type, prompt)

def load_context_files(agent_type):
    """Load required files for agent based on role definition."""
    required_files = AGENT_REQUIRED_FILES[agent_type]

    context = {}
    for file_path, reason in required_files.items():
        context[file_path] = {
            "content": read_file(file_path),
            "reason": reason
        }

    return context
```

**Performance Impact**:

Before:
```python
# Agent searches for ROADMAP
roadmap_files = glob("docs/**/*ROADMAP*")  # Slow!
for f in roadmap_files:
    if "ROADMAP.md" in f:
        roadmap = read_file(f)
```

After:
```python
# Agent receives ROADMAP upfront
roadmap = context["docs/roadmap/ROADMAP.md"]["content"]  # Fast!
```

**Monitoring**:

```python
# generator logs unexpected searches
if agent_type != "code-searcher" and tool_call == "Glob":
    logger.warning(
        f"Agent '{agent_type}' used Glob unexpectedly. "
        f"Pattern: {pattern}. "
        f"Should context be clearer?"
    )

    # Create reflection trace
    reflector.add_trace({
        "type": "unexpected_file_search",
        "agent": agent_type,
        "tool": "Glob",
        "pattern": pattern,
        "suggestion": "Add to required files?"
    })
```

**Dependencies**:

- CRITICAL_FUNCTIONAL_REQUIREMENTS.md (v1.4) - "Agent File Access Patterns" section ✅
- All agent role definitions exist ✅
- generator routing mechanism exists ✅

**Success Metrics**:

- **Performance**: Reduced Glob/Grep calls by 80%+ (except code-searcher)
- **Clarity**: All agents have documented context requirements
- **Predictability**: Consistent agent startup time
- **Monitoring**: Unexpected searches logged and traced
- **Developer Experience**: Clearer what each agent needs

**Notes**:

**Why This Matters**:
1. **Performance**: File system operations are expensive
2. **Clarity**: Obvious what agent needs to work
3. **Debugging**: Easy to see if context is missing
4. **Separation of Concerns**: code-searcher handles discovery

**Related**:
- CRITICAL_FUNCTIONAL_REQUIREMENTS.md v1.4 - "Agent File Access Patterns"
- User observation: "I see agents looking for files - they should know!"

## US-043: Enable Parallel Agent Execution for Faster Delivery

**Status**: 📝 PLANNED - HIGH PRIORITY (Performance Critical)

**Created**: 2025-10-16

**Type**: Performance / Infrastructure

**Complexity**: Medium-High

**Estimated Effort**: 2-3 days

**User Story**:
As a User, I want agents to work in parallel as much as possible, so that work is delivered faster and the system is more efficient.

**Problem Statement**:

Currently, agents appear to execute mostly sequentially. The user rarely sees parallel execution, leading to slower delivery than expected and underutilization of system capabilities.

**User Feedback** (Critical):
> "I don't understand why I hardly see some agents working in parallel: this is not the expected behavior, we want agents to work in parallel as much as possible in order to deliver faster"

**Why Parallel Execution Is Safe**:

Thanks to our CFR enforcement (US-035, US-038, US-039):
1. **CFR-000**: No file conflicts possible (ownership enforced)
2. **US-035**: Singleton prevents same-agent conflicts
3. **US-038**: File ownership prevents cross-agent conflicts
4. **Different directories**: Different agents own different files

**Safe Parallel Combinations**:

| Agent 1 | Working On | Agent 2 | Working On | Safe? | Why? |
|---------|-----------|---------|-----------|-------|------|
| code_developer | coffee_maker/ | project_manager | docs/roadmap/ | ✅ YES | Different files (CFR-001) |
| code_developer | coffee_maker/ | architect | docs/architecture/ | ✅ YES | Different files (CFR-001) |
| project_manager | docs/roadmap/ | architect | docs/architecture/ | ✅ YES | Different files (CFR-001) |
| assistant | Creating demo | code_developer | Implementing | ✅ YES | assistant read-only |
| code_developer #1 | coffee_maker/ | code_developer #2 | coffee_maker/ | ❌ NO | Singleton (US-035) |
| project_manager #1 | ROADMAP.md | project_manager #2 | ROADMAP.md | ❌ NO | Singleton (US-035) |

**Example Parallel Workflow**:

```
Time 0:
  - code_developer: Implementing US-038 Phase 2 (coffee_maker/)
  - project_manager: Writing strategic spec for US-045 (docs/roadmap/)
  - assistant: Creating demo for US-036 (read-only, no files)
  - architect: Designing technical spec for US-046 (docs/architecture/)

All 4 agents working SIMULTANEOUSLY - no conflicts!

Sequential would take: 4 × 30 minutes = 120 minutes
Parallel takes: max(30, 30, 30, 30) = 30 minutes
Speedup: 4x faster! 🎉
```

**Requirements**:

### 1. Parallel Task Queue System

Create a task scheduler that:
- Accepts multiple tasks in a queue
- Dispatches non-conflicting tasks in parallel
- Monitors for conflicts (file ownership, singleton)
- Throttles execution (max N parallel agents, e.g., 4-6)
- Handles task completion and schedules next queued tasks

### 2. Conflict Detection

Before scheduling any task, check:
- **File Ownership**: Does task require files owned by running agent?
- **Singleton Constraints**: Is agent type already running? (US-035)
- **Dependencies**: Does task need results from other task?
- **Resource Limits**: Is system under heavy load?

Only schedule if NO conflicts detected.

### 3. Dependency Management

Tasks can declare dependencies:
- "Needs result from task X before starting"
- Dependent tasks wait for prerequisites to complete
- Independent tasks run immediately when scheduled
- Dependency graph visualization for debugging

### 4. Resource Management

Prevent system overload:
- Max parallel agents (configurable, default: 4)
- CPU/memory monitoring (don't overload system)
- Graceful degradation (reduce parallelism if system stressed)
- Priority-based scheduling (high-priority tasks first)

### 5. Status Visibility

Real-time dashboard showing:
- All currently running agents
- Queued tasks waiting to execute
- Task dependencies (who's waiting on what)
- Resource utilization (CPU, memory)
- Estimated completion times
- Historical speedup metrics

### 6. generator Integration

generator orchestrates parallel execution:
- Receives task requests from multiple sources
- Analyzes conflicts using FileOwnership registry
- Distributes tasks to available agents
- Collects results as they complete
- Handles failures gracefully (one agent fails, others continue)
- Creates reflection traces for learning

**Proposed Architecture**:

```python
class ParallelTaskScheduler:
    """
    Schedules agent tasks for parallel execution while respecting
    CFR-000 (no file conflicts), US-035 (singleton), and US-038 (ownership).
    """

            result = await agent_executor.execute(task)

            # Mark complete
            duration = time.time() - start_time
            task.complete(result, duration)

            logger.info(
                f"✅ Completed {task.agent_type}: {task.description} "
                f"({duration:.1f}s)"
            )

        except Exception as e:
            # Handle failure gracefully
            logger.error(
                f"❌ Failed {task.agent_type}: {task.description} - {e}"
            )
            task.fail(e)

        finally:
            # Unregister (free up slot)
            del self.running_agents[task.agent_type]

            # Try scheduling next queued task
            self._schedule_next_task()

    def _schedule_next_task(self) -> None:
        """Schedule next task from queue if possible."""
        if self.task_queue.empty():
            return

        # Get highest priority task
        next_task = self.task_queue.peek()

        # Check if it can run now (no conflicts)
        if not self._has_conflicts(next_task):
            # Remove from queue and execute
            self.task_queue.pop()
            self._execute_task(next_task)
```

✅ All 4 tasks completed in 15 minutes
   Sequential would have taken: 45 minutes
   Speedup: 3x faster! 🎉

# Check parallel execution status
$ poetry run project-manager parallel-status

Currently Running (3 agents):
  - code_developer: Implementing US-038 Phase 2 (75% complete, ~5 min left)
  - architect: Creating US-046 spec (40% complete, ~10 min left)
  - project_manager: Writing US-047 spec (90% complete, ~2 min left)

Queued (2 tasks):
  - assistant: Create demo (waiting: code_developer to finish)
  - code_developer: Implement US-049 (waiting: architect spec ready)

Resource Usage:
  - CPU: 45%
  - Memory: 2.3 GB / 16 GB
  - Max Parallel: 4
  - Speedup Today: 2.8x average
```

**Acceptance Criteria**:

- [ ] ParallelTaskScheduler class created with conflict detection
- [ ] Conflict detection checks file ownership (CFR-001, US-038)
- [ ] Conflict detection checks singleton constraints (US-035)
- [ ] Dependency management (task A → task B)
- [ ] Max parallel limit configurable (default: 4)
- [ ] Real-time status dashboard (running, queued, dependencies)
- [ ] generator orchestrates all parallel execution
- [ ] Graceful failure handling (one agent fails, others continue)
- [ ] Resource monitoring (CPU, memory, throttling)
- [ ] Comprehensive tests (unit + integration)
- [ ] CLI command: `delegate-multiple` for parallel tasks
- [ ] CLI command: `parallel-status` for visibility
- [ ] Documentation: How to use parallel execution
- [ ] Performance metrics: Speedup measurements (before/after)

**Quick Wins (Can Implement Immediately)**:

Even before full parallel scheduler, we can enable parallel execution for obvious cases:

**Approach 1: Manual Parallel Delegation**:
```python
# In assistant or user_listener
parallel_tasks = [
    Task(subagent_type="code-developer", description="Task 1", prompt="..."),
    Task(subagent_type="architect", description="Task 2", prompt="..."),
    Task(subagent_type="project-manager", description="Task 3", prompt="..."),
]

# Execute all in parallel (current Task tool supports this!)
results = execute_parallel(parallel_tasks)
```

**Approach 2: Daemon Runs in Background**:
- code_developer daemon runs continuously (already does this)
- Other agents can work on other tasks simultaneously
- User can invoke commands while daemon works

**Immediate Action**: Document how to use existing parallel capabilities!

**Edge Cases**:

1. **What if all queued tasks conflict?**
   → Wait for running agent to finish, then schedule next
   → User notified: "Task queued, waiting for X to finish"

2. **What if system overloaded?**
   → Reduce max_parallel temporarily (e.g., 4 → 2)
   → Queue new tasks until load decreases
   → User notified: "System under load, task queued"

3. **What if agent crashes?**
   → Catch exception, log error, unregister agent
   → Reschedule task (with retry limit)
   → Don't block other agents (graceful degradation)
   → User notified: "Task X failed, retrying..."

4. **What if dependency cycle?**
   → Detect cycle during scheduling (graph traversal)
   → Raise clear error: "Dependency cycle: A→B→C→A"
   → User asked to resolve cycle

**Integration with Existing System**:

- **US-035 (Singleton)**: Check agent registry before scheduling
- **US-038 (Ownership)**: Check FileOwnership registry for conflicts
- **US-039 (CFR)**: Validate all tasks respect CFRs
- **US-042 (Context-Upfront)**: Agents receive context, no searching
- **generator**: Orchestrates all parallel execution (ACE framework)

**Performance Targets**:

- **Speedup**: 3-4x for independent tasks (measured)
- **Scheduling Overhead**: <100ms per task
- **Parallel Capacity**: 4-6 agents comfortably
- **Graceful Degradation**: Reduce parallelism under load
- **Resource Efficiency**: <50% CPU, <4GB memory for 4 agents

**Testing Strategy**:

**Unit Tests**:
```python
def test_scheduler_detects_file_conflicts():
    """Scheduler blocks tasks with file ownership conflicts."""
    scheduler = ParallelTaskScheduler()

    # Schedule code_developer task
    task1 = Task(agent_type="code_developer", files=["coffee_maker/"])
    scheduler.schedule_task(task1)

    # Try to schedule another code_developer task (singleton conflict)
    task2 = Task(agent_type="code_developer", files=["coffee_maker/"])
    scheduler.schedule_task(task2)

    # task2 should be queued, not running
    assert len(scheduler.running_agents) == 1
    assert scheduler.task_queue.size() == 1

def test_scheduler_allows_parallel_no_conflicts():
    """Scheduler allows parallel tasks with no conflicts."""
    scheduler = ParallelTaskScheduler()

    # Schedule 3 tasks with different file ownership
    tasks = [
        Task(agent_type="code_developer", files=["coffee_maker/"]),
        Task(agent_type="project_manager", files=["docs/roadmap/"]),
        Task(agent_type="architect", files=["docs/architecture/"]),
    ]

    for task in tasks:
        scheduler.schedule_task(task)

    # All 3 should be running in parallel
    assert len(scheduler.running_agents) == 3
    assert scheduler.task_queue.size() == 0
```

**Integration Tests**:
```python
@pytest.mark.asyncio
async def test_parallel_execution_end_to_end():
    """Full parallel execution with multiple agents."""
    scheduler = ParallelTaskScheduler()

    # Schedule 4 independent tasks
    tasks = [
        Task(agent_type="code_developer", description="Implement US-038"),
        Task(agent_type="architect", description="Design US-046"),
        Task(agent_type="project_manager", description="Write US-047 spec"),
        Task(agent_type="assistant", description="Create demo"),
    ]

    for task in tasks:
        scheduler.schedule_task(task)

    # Wait for all to complete
    await scheduler.wait_all()

    # All should be successful
    assert all(task.status == "completed" for task in tasks)

    # Measure speedup
    total_time = max(task.duration for task in tasks)
    sequential_time = sum(task.duration for task in tasks)
    speedup = sequential_time / total_time

    assert speedup >= 3.0  # At least 3x faster
```

**Priority Justification**:

**HIGH PRIORITY** because:
1. **User Request**: Direct user feedback about performance
2. **Delivery Speed**: 3-4x faster delivery for independent work
3. **Resource Utilization**: Better use of system capabilities
4. **User Satisfaction**: Visible performance improvement
5. **Competitive Advantage**: Faster than sequential systems

**Dependencies**:

- ✅ US-035 (Singleton Enforcement) - COMPLETE
- ✅ US-038 Phase 1 (File Ownership Registry) - COMPLETE
- ✅ US-041 (architect Operational) - COMPLETE

**Unblocks**:

- Faster delivery for all future work
- Better system resource utilization
- User satisfaction with performance
- Competitive advantage over sequential systems

**Estimated Effort**: 2-3 days

**Day 1: Task Scheduler & Conflict Detection** (8 hours)
- ParallelTaskScheduler class
- Conflict detection (file ownership, singleton, dependencies)
- Resource management (max parallel, throttling)
- Unit tests (90% coverage)

**Day 2: generator Integration & CLI Commands** (8 hours)
- generator orchestration of parallel execution
- CLI commands (delegate-multiple, parallel-status)
- Integration tests (end-to-end workflows)
- Dashboard UI for status visibility

**Day 3: Testing, Monitoring, Documentation** (8 hours)
- Comprehensive testing (edge cases, failure scenarios)
- Performance metrics and speedup measurements
- Documentation (user guide, API reference)
- Reflection traces for learning

**Related Documents**:

- docs/roadmap/CRITICAL_FUNCTIONAL_REQUIREMENTS.md - CFR-000, US-035, US-038
- .claude/CLAUDE.md - Agent ownership matrix
- docs/roadmap/TEAM_COLLABORATION.md - Agent collaboration workflows

**Notes**:

This user story directly addresses user feedback about lack of parallel execution. The infrastructure is ready (CFR enforcement, singleton, ownership), we just need the scheduling layer to enable it.

## US-044: Regular Refactoring and Technical Debt Reduction Workflow

**Status**: 📝 PLANNED - HIGH PRIORITY (Code Quality)

**Created**: 2025-10-16

**Type**: Process / Workflow

**Complexity**: Medium

**Estimated Effort**: 2-3 days

**User Story**:

As a User, I want code_developer to perform regular refactoring, simplification, and technical debt reduction on instructions from architect, so that the codebase remains clean, maintainable, and efficient over time.

**Problem Statement**:

Currently:
- Technical debt accumulates over time
- Code becomes harder to maintain
- Refactoring happens reactively (when things break)
- No proactive code quality management
- No systematic approach to identifying refactoring opportunities

**User Requirements** (2025-10-16):

1. "I want the code_developer to do code refactoring/simplification/technical debt reduction on a regular basis"
2. "He should do this on instructions from the code-architect who decides when it is time for this"
3. "architect should have prepared upfront the technical tasks and sub-tasks for code_developer to know what to do"

**Solution**:

architect proactively monitors code quality and schedules refactoring work for code_developer.

**Workflow**:

```
architect (monitors code quality regularly)
    ↓
architect (detects technical debt/complexity)
    ↓
architect (creates refactoring plan)
    ↓
architect (creates technical tasks for code_developer)
    ↓
code_developer (executes refactoring tasks)
    ↓

**Priority Justification**:

**HIGH PRIORITY** because:
1. **User Request**: Direct user requirement for regular refactoring
2. **Code Quality**: Prevents technical debt accumulation
3. **Maintainability**: Keeps codebase clean and understandable
4. **Velocity**: Clean code = faster feature development
5. **Sustainability**: Long-term system health

**Estimated Effort**: 2-3 days

**Day 1: Setup Infrastructure** (8 hours)
- Create docs/architecture/refactoring/ directory
- Create REFACTOR_TEMPLATE.md template
- Integrate radon/pylint metrics
- Setup weekly monitoring script
- Create example refactoring plan

**Day 2: architect Workflow** (8 hours)

**Integration**:

This workflow respects ownership boundaries (CFR-001):
- **architect**: Creates refactoring plans (owns docs/architecture/refactoring/)
- **project_manager**: Adds REFACTOR priorities to ROADMAP (owns docs/roadmap/)
- **code_developer**: Executes refactoring (owns coffee_maker/)

**Dependencies**:

- ✅ US-041 (architect Operational) - COMPLETE
- ✅ CFR-001 (Document Ownership) - COMPLETE
- 📝 CFR-005 (Ownership Maintenance) - PLANNED (this US creates it)

**Unblocks**:

- Systematic code quality improvement
- Proactive technical debt reduction
- Sustainable long-term development
- CFR-005 implementation (ownership maintenance responsibility)

**Related Documents**:

- docs/roadmap/CRITICAL_FUNCTIONAL_REQUIREMENTS.md - Will add CFR-005
- .claude/CLAUDE.md - Agent ownership matrix
- docs/roadmap/TEAM_COLLABORATION.md - Agent collaboration

**Related CFRs**:

This US implements CFR-005 (Ownership Includes Maintenance Responsibility):
- architect monitors code quality (proactive maintenance)
- architect schedules refactoring (maintenance planning)
- code_developer executes refactoring (maintenance execution)

**Notes**:

This user story addresses the user's requirement for regular, systematic refactoring. architect takes the lead on deciding WHEN and WHAT to refactor, while code_developer executes the refactoring based on architect's detailed plans.

**Implementation Progress** (2025-10-16):

**Phase 1: Infrastructure Setup - COMPLETE**
- Created docs/architecture/refactoring/ directory structure (active/, completed/, templates/)
- Created REFACTOR_TEMPLATE.md template for architect to use
- Created example refactoring plan (REFACTOR_2025_10_16_daemon_simplification.md)
- Integrated code complexity tools (radon 6.0.1, pylint 4.0.1)
- Created check_complexity.sh script for monitoring
- Generated baseline complexity metrics (baseline_complexity_2025_10_16.txt)

Infrastructure is now ready for architect to create refactoring plans and for code_developer to execute them.

**Next Steps** (Phase 2 - Workflow Automation):
- architect monitoring workflow (weekly metrics review)
- architect refactoring plan generation workflow
- code_developer refactoring execution workflow
- ROADMAP integration (REFACTOR-XXX priorities)
- architect review process automation

## PRIORITY 10: Standalone user-listener UI Command

**Status**: ✅ **COMPLETE** (2025-10-16)

**User Story**: [US-046] Create Standalone user-listener UI Command

**What**: Create a dedicated `user-listener` command that serves as the unified UI interface and primary entry point for all user interactions with the autonomous agent system.

**Why**:
- **Architectural Alignment**: Matches documented architecture in CLAUDE.md where `user_listener` is defined as the PRIMARY USER INTERFACE
- **Clear Separation of Concerns**: Establishes clear boundary between UI (user_listener) and backend agents (project_manager, architect, code-searcher, etc.)
- **Full Agent Delegation**: Enables proper delegation to all specialized agents through a single, consistent interface
- **User Experience**: Provides a unified, intuitive command for all user interactions instead of using `project-manager chat`

**Current State**:
- `project-manager chat` currently provides UI functionality
- Architecture documentation refers to `user_listener` as PRIMARY USER INTERFACE
- Mismatch between implementation and documented architecture

**Context**:
The project architecture in CLAUDE.md clearly defines `user_listener` as the "PRIMARY USER INTERFACE - Interprets user intent and delegates to team (ONLY agent with UI)". However, the current implementation uses `project-manager chat` for UI interactions. This priority will align the implementation with the documented architecture by creating a proper standalone `user-listener` command.

**Deliverables**:

1. **Core Implementation**:
   - Create `coffee_maker/cli/user_listener.py` with ChatSession implementation
   - Implement interactive chat interface with rich terminal UI
   - Markdown rendering, syntax highlighting, streaming responses
   - Multi-line input, command history, auto-completion

2. **Agent Delegation System**:
   - Delegate strategic tasks to project_manager (ROADMAP updates, GitHub monitoring, status reports)
   - Delegate architectural decisions to architect (technical specs, ADRs, dependencies)
   - Delegate code analysis to code-searcher (deep codebase analysis, forensics)
   - Delegate demos and bug reports to assistant (Puppeteer demos, comprehensive bug analysis)
   - Delegate design decisions to ux-design-expert (UI/UX, Tailwind CSS)

3. **Command Registration**:
   - Register `user-listener` command in pyproject.toml
   - Add command to main CLI entry points

4. **Singleton Enforcement**:
   - Add AgentType.USER_LISTENER to AgentRegistry
   - Enforce only one UI session at a time
   - Proper cleanup on exit

5. **Agent Configuration**:
   - Create `.claude/agents/user_listener.md` with agent definition
   - Document role, responsibilities, delegation rules
   - Define communication protocols

6. **Documentation Updates**:
   - Update CLAUDE.md with new command usage
   - Update README.md with user-listener command examples
   - Document delegation workflow
   - Add troubleshooting guide

**Acceptance Criteria**:

- [ ] `poetry run user-listener` starts interactive UI successfully
- [ ] Command provides rich terminal experience (markdown, syntax highlighting, streaming)
- [ ] Delegates to project_manager for strategic tasks (ROADMAP, GitHub, status)
- [ ] Delegates to architect for architectural decisions (specs, ADRs, dependencies)
- [ ] Delegates to code-searcher for code analysis (deep analysis, patterns)
- [ ] Delegates to assistant for demos and bug reports (Puppeteer, comprehensive QA)
- [ ] Delegates to ux-design-expert for design decisions (UI/UX, Tailwind)
- [ ] AgentRegistry enforces singleton (only one UI session at time)
- [ ] All existing unit tests pass
- [ ] New integration tests for user_listener added
- [ ] Documentation updated in CLAUDE.md and README.md
- [ ] Agent configuration exists in `.claude/agents/user_listener.md`

**Estimated Effort**: 4-6 hours

**Day 1: Core Implementation** (2-3 hours)
- Create `coffee_maker/cli/user_listener.py`
- Implement ChatSession with rich terminal UI
- Add basic agent delegation framework
- Register command in pyproject.toml

**Day 2: Delegation & Testing** (2-3 hours)
- Implement full agent delegation system
- Add AgentRegistry singleton enforcement
- Create agent configuration in `.claude/agents/user_listener.md`
- Write integration tests
- Update documentation (CLAUDE.md, README.md)

**Dependencies**: None (can start immediately)

**Technical Specification Required**: Yes

**Delegation to architect**: This priority requires architectural design before implementation. The technical specification should be created by the architect agent and should include:
- Detailed class design for user_listener
- Agent delegation mechanism and protocols
- Integration with existing ChatSession infrastructure
- Singleton enforcement strategy
- Error handling and edge cases
- Testing strategy

**Priority Level**: MEDIUM-HIGH

**Rationale**:
- Aligns implementation with documented architecture
- Improves separation of concerns
- Enables proper agent delegation patterns
- Better user experience with unified interface

**Related Documents**:
- `.claude/CLAUDE.md` - Agent ownership matrix and architecture
- `.claude/agents/README.md` - Agent registry
- `docs/roadmap/TEAM_COLLABORATION.md` - Agent collaboration guidelines
- `coffee_maker/cli/roadmap_cli.py` - Current chat implementation reference

**Unblocks**: None

**Blocked By**: None

**Notes**:
This priority addresses the architectural mismatch between documentation (user_listener as PRIMARY UI) and implementation (project-manager chat). Creating a dedicated user-listener command will improve code clarity, maintain architectural consistency, and provide a better foundation for future UI enhancements.

### US-047: Enforce CFR-008 Architect-Only Spec Creation

**PRIORITY**: 12 (CRITICAL - Role Boundaries)

**Status**: ✅ Complete - CRITICAL (Role Boundaries)

**Created**: 2025-10-16

**Estimated Effort**: 2-3 days

**User Story**:
As the architect agent, I want to be the ONLY agent that creates technical specifications, and I want to do this proactively for ALL ROADMAP priorities, so that we have consistent architectural design, optimal reuse opportunities, and cross-feature integration.

**Problem Statement**:
Currently, there is inconsistency in role boundaries:
- **code_developer sometimes creates specs**: This violates separation of concerns and leads to suboptimal architectural decisions
- **Specs created reactively**: Only when code_developer encounters a priority, missing big-picture optimization
- **No cross-feature planning**: Each priority designed in isolation without considering dependencies and reuse
- **Architectural debt accumulates**: Without proactive design, implementation complexity grows unnecessarily

This is a **Critical Functional Requirement** (CFR-008) that must be enforced system-wide.

**Description**:
Implement strict role boundary enforcement where ONLY the architect agent creates technical specifications, and architect does this proactively for the FULL ROADMAP (not reactively per priority).

**Requirements**:

1. **Remove Spec Creation from code_developer**:
   - Remove all spec creation logic from `daemon.py`
   - Remove `_ensure_technical_spec()` method
   - Remove template-based fallback spec generation
   - code_developer ONLY reads specs created by architect

2. **Architect Proactive Spec Creation**:
   - architect reviews FULL ROADMAP regularly
   - Creates specs for ALL priorities requiring design
   - Considers cross-feature dependencies
   - Identifies reuse opportunities across priorities
   - Optimizes for simplification (ADR-003)

3. **Spec Readiness Verification**:
   - code_developer checks if spec exists before starting work
   - If no spec exists, code_developer BLOCKS and notifies project_manager
   - project_manager alerts user: "Priority X blocked - needs architect spec"
   - User can then invoke architect to create spec

4. **Automated Enforcement**:
   - Add validation in daemon startup
   - Check that all Planned priorities have specs (or are marked as "No spec needed")
   - Warn if specs are missing
   - Prevent code_developer from creating specs

5. **Documentation Updates**:
   - Update CFR-008 in CRITICAL_FUNCTIONAL_REQUIREMENTS.md (already done)
   - Update CLAUDE.md with enforced workflow
   - Update architect.md with proactive responsibilities
   - Update code_developer.md to remove spec creation

6. **Monitoring & Metrics**:
   - Track: % of priorities with specs before implementation
   - Track: Spec creation lead time (how far ahead architect works)
   - Track: Architectural reuse rate (% of specs using shared components)
   - Alert if code_developer attempts spec creation

**Acceptance Criteria**:

- [ ] code_developer CANNOT create specs (logic removed from daemon.py)
- [ ] code_developer BLOCKS on missing spec (notifies project_manager)
- [ ] architect creates specs proactively for FULL ROADMAP
- [ ] Specs exist BEFORE code_developer starts work (not during)
- [ ] Validation enforces spec presence for complex priorities
- [ ] Documentation updated (CLAUDE.md, architect.md, code_developer.md)
- [ ] CFR-008 fully enforced system-wide
- [ ] Monitoring tracks spec readiness metrics
- [ ] All tests pass with new workflow
- [ ] User receives clear notifications when specs are missing

**Correct Flow (After Implementation)**:
```
architect (proactively):
  → Reviews FULL ROADMAP
  → Creates ALL needed specs
  → Ensures architectural consistency
  → Considers cross-feature dependencies
  → Optimizes for simplification and reuse
  → Commits specs to docs/architecture/specs/

code_developer:
  → Reads spec created by architect
  → Implements exactly what spec describes
  → NEVER creates specs
  → NEVER modifies specs
  → BLOCKS if spec missing (notifies project_manager)

project_manager:
  → Monitors spec readiness
  → Alerts user if priorities blocked by missing specs
  → Tracks metrics on spec creation lead time
```

**Incorrect Flow (Current - To Be Eliminated)**:
```
code_developer:
  → Encounters priority without spec
  → Creates spec using template fallback ❌ WRONG
  → Implements based on self-created spec ❌ WRONG
  → No cross-feature optimization ❌ WRONG
```

**Estimated Effort**: 2-3 days

**Day 1: Remove Spec Creation from code_developer** (4-6 hours)
- Remove spec creation logic from daemon.py
- Add blocking logic when spec missing
- Add notification to project_manager
- Update code_developer.md documentation

**Day 2: Architect Proactive Workflow** (4-6 hours)
- Implement architect's ROADMAP review process
- Add automated spec readiness checks
- Create monitoring and metrics
- Update architect.md documentation

**Day 3: Testing & Documentation** (2-4 hours)
- Write integration tests for enforcement
- Update CLAUDE.md with new workflow
- Test full cycle: architect creates spec → code_developer implements
- Verify blocking works correctly

**Dependencies**: None (CFR-008 already documented)

**Technical Specification Required**: Yes

**Delegation to architect**: This priority requires architectural design for:
- Spec readiness validation mechanism
- Blocking and notification system
- Monitoring and metrics collection
- Integration with existing daemon workflow

**Priority Level**: CRITICAL

**Rationale**:
- **Separation of Concerns**: architect designs, code_developer implements
- **Architectural Consistency**: Single authority for technical decisions
- **Optimization**: architect sees full ROADMAP, identifies reuse opportunities
- **Quality**: Proactive design reduces implementation complexity by 30-87% (per ADR-003)
- **CFR Compliance**: Enforces Critical Functional Requirement system-wide

**Related Documents**:
- `docs/roadmap/CRITICAL_FUNCTIONAL_REQUIREMENTS.md` - CFR-008
- `docs/architecture/decisions/ADR-003-simplification-first-approach.md` - Simplification principles
- `.claude/agents/architect.md` - Architect role definition
- `.claude/agents/code_developer.md` - code_developer role definition

**Unblocks**: All future priorities (ensures specs exist before implementation)

**Blocked By**: None

**Notes**:
This is a **Critical Functional Requirement** that must be enforced to maintain architectural quality and prevent suboptimal implementations. The architect agent has the big-picture view needed to make optimal design decisions across the full ROADMAP.

### US-048: Enforce CFR-009 Silent Background Agents

**PRIORITY**: 13 (HIGH - User Experience)

**Status**: 🔄 In Progress - HIGH PRIORITY (User Experience)

**Created**: 2025-10-16

**Estimated Effort**: 4-6 hours

**User Story**:
As a user, I want ONLY the user_listener agent to play sound notifications, so that background agents (code_developer, project_manager, etc.) work silently without interrupting me.

**Problem Statement**:
Currently, background agents play sound notifications:
- **code_developer plays sounds**: "Max Retries Reached" interrupts user
- **Confusing UX**: User doesn't know which agent is notifying them
- **Noise pollution**: Multiple background agents creating sounds
- **User expectation violated**: Background work should be silent

This is a **Critical Functional Requirement** (CFR-009) that must be enforced system-wide.

**Description**:
Implement strict enforcement where ONLY the user_listener agent can play sound notifications. All background agents (code_developer, project_manager, architect, assistant, etc.) MUST use `sound=False` in all notification calls.

**Requirements**:

1. **Update NotificationDB API**:
   - Add `allow_sound` parameter to `create()` method
   - Default `allow_sound=True` for user_listener
   - Default `allow_sound=False` for all other agents
   - Enforce in notification creation logic

2. **Update All Background Agents**:
   - code_developer: Set `sound=False` in ALL notification calls
   - project_manager: Set `sound=False` in ALL notification calls
   - architect: Set `sound=False` in ALL notification calls (future)
   - assistant: Set `sound=False` in ALL notification calls (future)
   - Any other background agents: Set `sound=False`

3. **Automated Enforcement**:
   - Add validation in NotificationDB.create()
   - Check caller identity (which agent is calling)
   - Raise error if background agent tries `sound=True`
   - Allow only user_listener to use `sound=True`

4. **Agent Identity Tracking**:
   - Add `agent_id` parameter to NotificationDB.create()
   - Pass agent type (from AgentRegistry) with each call
   - Use for validation and auditing
   - Log violations for debugging

5. **Documentation Updates**:
   - Update CFR-009 in CRITICAL_FUNCTIONAL_REQUIREMENTS.md (already done)
   - Update CLAUDE.md with sound notification rules
   - Update each agent's .md with sound=False requirement
   - Add examples in agent documentation

6. **Audit Existing Code**:
   - Search codebase for all `notifications.create()` calls
   - Update ALL calls from background agents to `sound=False`
   - Verify user_listener uses `sound=True` appropriately
   - Add tests to prevent regressions

**Acceptance Criteria**:

- [ ] ONLY user_listener can play sound notifications
- [ ] ALL background agents use `sound=False`
- [ ] NotificationDB enforces sound permission by agent identity
- [ ] Validation raises clear error if violation attempted
- [ ] All existing notification calls updated (code_developer, project_manager)
- [ ] Future agents default to `sound=False`
- [ ] Documentation updated (CFR-009, CLAUDE.md, agent .md files)
- [ ] Tests verify enforcement works
- [ ] Audit log captures any violations
- [ ] User experience is silent for background work

**Correct Usage (After Implementation)**:
```python
# ✅ CORRECT (code_developer, project_manager, architect, assistant - background agents)
self.notifications.create(
    title="Task Complete",
    message="PRIORITY 9 implemented successfully",
    level="info",
    sound=False,  # Silent for background work
    agent_id=AgentType.CODE_DEVELOPER
)

# ✅ CORRECT (user_listener only - UI agent)
self.notifications.create(
    title="User Action Required",
    message="Please review PR #123",
    level="high",
    sound=True,  # Sound allowed for user interaction
    agent_id=AgentType.USER_LISTENER
)

# ❌ INCORRECT (background agent trying to play sound)
self.notifications.create(
    title="Error Occurred",
    message="Max retries reached",
    level="error",
    sound=True,  # ❌ RAISES ERROR - only user_listener can use sound=True
    agent_id=AgentType.CODE_DEVELOPER
)
```

**Estimated Effort**: 4-6 hours

**Phase 1: Enforcement Mechanism** (2-3 hours)
- Update NotificationDB.create() with agent_id parameter
- Add validation logic for sound permission
- Implement error raising for violations
- Add audit logging

**Phase 2: Update All Agents** (1-2 hours)
- Audit all `notifications.create()` calls in codebase
- Update code_developer to use `sound=False`
- Update project_manager to use `sound=False`
- Add agent_id to all calls

**Phase 3: Testing & Documentation** (1-2 hours)
- Write unit tests for enforcement
- Write integration tests for each agent
- Update CLAUDE.md and agent .md files
- Verify no violations remain

**Dependencies**: None (can start immediately)

**Technical Specification Required**: No (straightforward implementation)

**Priority Level**: HIGH

**Rationale**:
- **User Experience**: Background agents should not interrupt users
- **Clarity**: Only UI agent (user_listener) should play sounds
- **Noise Reduction**: Prevents notification fatigue
- **CFR Compliance**: Enforces Critical Functional Requirement

**Related Documents**:
- `docs/roadmap/CRITICAL_FUNCTIONAL_REQUIREMENTS.md` - CFR-009
- `coffee_maker/cli/notifications.py` - NotificationDB implementation
- `.claude/agents/user_listener.md` - user_listener role (sound allowed)
- `.claude/agents/code_developer.md` - code_developer role (silent)

**Unblocks**: None

**Blocked By**: None

**Notes**:
This is a quick win that significantly improves user experience. Background agents should work silently, with only the user_listener agent playing sounds for user-facing interactions.

### US-049: Architect Continuous Spec Improvement Loop (CFR-010)

**PRIORITY**: 14 (HIGH - Quality & Efficiency)

**Status**: ✅ Complete - HIGH PRIORITY (Quality & Efficiency)

**Created**: 2025-10-16
**Completed**: 2025-10-19

**Estimated Effort**: 1-2 days

**User Story**:
As the architect agent, I want to continuously review and improve all technical specifications on a regular basis, so that we reduce implementation complexity, increase code reuse, and maintain architectural quality over time.

**Problem Statement**:
Currently, specs are created once and never revisited:
- **One-and-done mentality**: Specs created, implemented, forgotten
- **No continuous improvement**: Lessons learned from implementation not fed back
- **Complexity accumulates**: Each new spec designed in isolation
- **Missed reuse opportunities**: Shared patterns not identified across priorities
- **Architectural drift**: No regular review to maintain consistency

This is a **Critical Functional Requirement** (CFR-010) that ensures architect thinks ahead about complexities and continuously reduces them to the minimum.

**Description**:
Implement a continuous improvement loop where architect regularly reviews ALL specs and the FULL ROADMAP to identify simplification opportunities, reuse patterns, and architectural improvements.

**Requirements**:

1. **Regular Review Schedule**:
   - **Daily**: Quick review of ROADMAP changes (5-10 minutes)
   - **Weekly**: Deep review of all active specs (1-2 hours)
   - **Before Each New Spec**: Review existing specs for patterns and reuse
   - **After Implementation**: Review spec based on what was actually built

2. **Review Deliverables**:
   - **Weekly Improvement Report**: `docs/architecture/WEEKLY_SPEC_REVIEW_[date].md`
   - **Updated Specs**: Simpler implementations, better examples, clearer guidance
   - **New ADRs**: Document significant architectural improvements
   - **Reuse Catalog**: Shared components, patterns, utilities identified

3. **Metrics to Track**:
   - **Simplification Rate**: % reduction in implementation complexity
   - **Reuse Rate**: % of new specs using shared components
   - **Effort Saved**: Hours saved by spec improvements
   - **Implementation Accuracy**: How closely implementations match specs
   - **Architectural Consistency**: Adherence to established patterns

4. **Automated Triggers**:
   - ROADMAP changes trigger daily review
   - New priority added triggers spec creation evaluation
   - Implementation completion triggers post-implementation review
   - Weekly cron job triggers deep review (future)

5. **Review Process**:
   - **Read FULL ROADMAP**: Understand all priorities and dependencies
   - **Read ALL Specs**: Review existing technical specifications
   - **Identify Patterns**: Find common components across priorities
   - **Simplify**: Apply ADR-003 principles to reduce complexity
   - **Document**: Create weekly report with findings and improvements

6. **Integration with Workflow**:
   - architect proactively performs reviews (no user request needed)
   - project_manager monitors review frequency (alerts if skipped)
   - code_developer benefits from improved specs (easier implementation)
   - Weekly reports visible to user in notifications

**Acceptance Criteria**:

- [x] architect performs daily quick reviews of ROADMAP changes
- [x] architect performs weekly deep reviews of all specs
- [x] Weekly improvement reports created in `docs/architecture/WEEKLY_SPEC_REVIEW_[date].md`
- [x] Metrics tracked for simplification rate, reuse rate, effort saved
- [x] Updated specs reflect continuous improvements
- [x] New ADRs document significant architectural decisions
- [x] Reuse catalog maintained and updated
- [x] Automated triggers invoke architect reviews
- [x] project_manager monitors review frequency
- [x] Documentation updated (CFR-010, architect.md, CLAUDE.md)
- [x] All tests pass with new workflow

**Review Deliverable Format**:
```markdown
# Weekly Spec Review - 2025-10-16

## Summary
Reviewed 8 specs, identified 3 reuse opportunities, simplified 2 implementations.

## Metrics
- **Simplification Rate**: 60% (12 hours → 5 hours average)
- **Reuse Rate**: 37.5% (3/8 specs using shared components)
- **Effort Saved**: 14 hours this week
- **Architectural Consistency**: 100% (all specs follow ADR-003)

## Improvements Made
1. **SPEC-009**: Reduced complexity by 87.5% (reusing DeveloperStatus)
2. **SPEC-010**: Identified shared notification component (3 specs can reuse)
3. **SPEC-011**: Simplified from 5 modules to 2 modules

## Reuse Opportunities Identified
- NotificationDB: Used by 4 priorities
- DeveloperStatus: Used by 3 priorities
- AgentRegistry: Used by 5 priorities

## Recommendations
1. Create shared utility for JSON file operations (used in 6 specs)
2. Extract common validation logic into reusable module
3. Consider creating shared testing utilities

## Next Week Focus
- Review new priorities 11-15
- Create shared utilities module
- Update older specs with new patterns
```

**Estimated Effort**: 1-2 days (initial implementation)

**Day 1: Review Process Implementation** (4-6 hours)
- Create review process workflow
- Implement metrics tracking
- Create first weekly review report template
- Document process in architect.md

**Day 2: Automation & Integration** (4-6 hours)
- Add automated triggers for reviews
- Integrate with project_manager monitoring
- Create notification system for review completion
- Write tests for review workflow

**Ongoing**: 1-2 hours per week for reviews

**Dependencies**:
- US-047 (architect must create all specs before reviewing them)

**Technical Specification Required**: Yes

**Delegation to architect**: This priority requires architectural design for:
- Review workflow and automation
- Metrics collection and tracking
- Integration with existing daemon workflow
- Report generation and storage

**Priority Level**: HIGH

**Rationale**:
- **Continuous Improvement**: Specs get better over time, not worse
- **Complexity Reduction**: Proactive simplification before implementation
- **Code Reuse**: Identify shared patterns across priorities
- **Quality**: Maintain architectural consistency
- **Efficiency**: Reduce implementation time by 30-87% (per ADR-003)
- **CFR Compliance**: Enforces Critical Functional Requirement

**Related Documents**:
- `docs/roadmap/CRITICAL_FUNCTIONAL_REQUIREMENTS.md` - CFR-010
- `docs/architecture/decisions/ADR-003-simplification-first-approach.md` - Simplification principles
- `.claude/agents/architect.md` - Architect role definition
- `docs/architecture/WEEKLY_SPEC_REVIEW_2025-10-16.md` - First review example

**Unblocks**: All future priorities (improved specs = easier implementation)

**Blocked By**: US-047 (architect must create specs before reviewing them)

**Notes**:
This is the **continuous improvement loop** that ensures architectural quality doesn't degrade over time. The first weekly review (2025-10-16) already shows 12-16 hours of effort savings - this demonstrates the value of regular spec review and improvement.

**Example Success**: The first review identified that SPEC-009 could be simplified by 87.5% (2 weeks → 2 days) by reusing existing infrastructure. This is exactly the kind of improvement that continuous review enables.

### US-054: Architect Daily Integration of code-searcher Findings (CFR-011)

**PRIORITY**: 15 (CRITICAL - CFR-011 Enforcement)

**Status**: ✅ Complete - CRITICAL (CFR-011 Enforcement)

**Created**: 2025-10-17

**Estimated Effort**: 1-2 days

**User Story**:
As the architect agent, I must read code-searcher analysis reports daily and analyze the codebase weekly to identify refactoring opportunities and technical debt reduction, so that all findings are integrated into technical specifications before creating new specs.

**Problem Statement**:
Currently, code-searcher produces valuable analysis reports about code quality, duplication, technical debt, and refactoring opportunities, but architect does not systematically integrate these findings:
- **Reports ignored**: code-searcher reports sit unread in docs/
- **Technical debt accumulates**: Refactoring opportunities missed
- **Duplicate work**: Same patterns implemented multiple times
- **Quality degradation**: Code quality issues not addressed proactively
- **No enforcement**: No mechanism to ensure architect reads reports

This is a **Critical Functional Requirement** (CFR-011) that ensures architect maintains code quality through continuous integration of code-searcher findings.

**Description**:
Implement enforcement mechanism where architect MUST read code-searcher reports daily AND analyze the codebase weekly before being allowed to create new technical specifications. This creates a feedback loop: code-searcher identifies issues → architect reads and acts on findings → new specs incorporate improvements → code_developer implements better code.

**Requirements**:

1. **Daily Integration Workflow**:
   - Check for new code-searcher reports every day
   - BLOCK spec creation if unread reports exist
   - Read all reports and extract action items
   - Update existing specs with findings
   - Create refactoring specs as needed

2. **Weekly Codebase Analysis**:
   - Analyze codebase yourself every 7 days (max)
   - Identify: large files, duplicate code, missing abstractions, test gaps
   - BLOCK spec creation if >7 days since last analysis
   - Document findings in analysis report
   - Create refactoring priorities based on findings

3. **Enforcement Mechanism**:
   - `ArchitectDailyRoutine` class with `enforce_cfr_011()` method
   - Raises `CFR011ViolationError` if violations detected
   - Tracking file: `data/architect_integration_status.json`
   - CLI commands: `architect daily-integration`, `architect analyze-codebase`
   - Integration with spec creation workflow

4. **Tracking Data** (`data/architect_integration_status.json`):
   ```json
   {
     "last_code_searcher_read": "2025-10-17",
     "last_codebase_analysis": "2025-10-17",
     "reports_read": 12,
     "refactoring_specs_created": 4,
     "specs_updated": 6,
     "next_analysis_due": "2025-10-24"
   }
   ```

5. **CLI Commands**:
   - `architect daily-integration` - Guided workflow for reading reports
   - `architect analyze-codebase` - Perform weekly codebase analysis
   - `architect cfr-011-status` - Check compliance status

**Acceptance Criteria**:

- [x] `ArchitectDailyRoutine` class implemented in `coffee_maker/autonomous/architect_daily_routine.py`
- [x] `CFR011ViolationError` exception defined
- [x] `enforce_cfr_011()` method raises exception if:
  - Unread code-searcher reports exist
  - >7 days since last codebase analysis
- [x] Tracking file `data/architect_integration_status.json` created and maintained
- [x] CLI command `architect daily-integration` works (guided workflow)
- [x] CLI command `architect analyze-codebase` works (performs analysis)
- [x] CLI command `architect cfr-011-status` works (shows compliance)
- [x] Spec creation workflow calls `enforce_cfr_011()` BEFORE creating specs
- [x] Unit tests for `ArchitectDailyRoutine` (100% coverage of enforcement logic) - 13 tests passing
- [x] Integration test: spec creation blocked when violations exist - 6 tests passing
- [x] Integration test: spec creation allowed when compliant - 6 tests passing
- [x] Documentation updated (CFR-011, architect.md, CLAUDE.md)
- [x] All tests pass (19/19 tests passing)

**Implementation Phases**:

**Phase 1: Core Enforcement Mechanism** (4-6 hours)
- Create `ArchitectDailyRoutine` class
- Implement `enforce_cfr_011()` with both checks:
  - Part 1: code-searcher report reading (daily)
  - Part 2: Codebase analysis (weekly)
- Define `CFR011ViolationError` exception
- Create tracking file structure
- Add file I/O for tracking data

**Phase 2: CLI Commands** (3-4 hours)
- Implement `architect daily-integration` command
- Implement `architect analyze-codebase` command
- Implement `architect cfr-011-status` command
- Add to `coffee_maker/cli/architect_cli.py` (new file)
- Integrate with existing CLI framework

**Phase 3: Workflow Integration** (2-3 hours)
- Integrate `enforce_cfr_011()` into spec creation workflow
- Add pre-check before `daemon_spec_manager` creates specs
- Handle exceptions gracefully (inform user, stop spec creation)
- Update architect agent prompt to include daily routine

**Phase 4: Testing & Documentation** (2-3 hours)
- Write unit tests for `ArchitectDailyRoutine`
- Write integration tests for spec creation blocking
- Update CFR-011 documentation
- Update architect.md agent definition
- Update CLAUDE.md with new workflow

**Estimated Effort**: 1-2 days (11-16 hours total)

**Dependencies**:
- US-047 (architect must be creating specs for enforcement to matter)
- code-searcher must be producing reports (already happening)

**Technical Specification Required**: Yes - architect will create detailed implementation spec

**Delegation to architect**: This priority requires architectural design for:
- Enforcement mechanism architecture
- Tracking file format and persistence
- CLI command structure
- Integration points with existing daemon workflow
- Exception handling strategy

**Priority Level**: CRITICAL

**Rationale**:
- **Code Quality**: Proactive identification and resolution of technical debt
- **Refactoring**: Systematic approach to code improvement
- **Learning Loop**: Architect learns from codebase analysis
- **Prevention**: Stop quality degradation before it becomes costly
- **CFR Compliance**: Enforces Critical Functional Requirement (CFR-011)
- **Efficiency**: Better specs from informed architect = faster implementation

**Related Documents**:
- `docs/roadmap/CRITICAL_FUNCTIONAL_REQUIREMENTS.md` - CFR-011 full definition
- `docs/architecture/specs/SPEC-050-refactor-roadmap-cli-modularization.md` - Example refactoring spec
- `docs/architecture/specs/SPEC-051-centralized-prompt-utilities.md` - Example refactoring spec
- `docs/architecture/specs/SPEC-052-standardized-error-handling.md` - Example refactoring spec
- `docs/architecture/specs/SPEC-053-test-coverage-expansion.md` - Example refactoring spec
- `docs/architecture/decisions/ADR-004-code-searcher-integration.md` - code-searcher integration approach
- `.claude/agents/architect.md` - Architect role definition
- `.claude/agents/code-searcher.md` - code-searcher role definition

**Unblocks**:
- US-049 (continuous spec improvement needs findings from code-searcher)
- All refactoring priorities (SPEC-050, SPEC-051, SPEC-052, SPEC-053)

**Blocked By**: None (can start immediately)

**Notes**:
This creates a powerful feedback loop:
1. code-searcher analyzes codebase → finds issues
2. architect reads reports daily → extracts improvements
3. architect creates/updates specs → incorporates findings
4. code_developer implements → better code quality
5. Repeat cycle → continuous improvement

**Success Metrics**:
- Reports read within 24 hours: 100%
- Codebase analysis frequency: Every 7 days (max)
- Refactoring specs created from findings: Track count
- Spec updates from findings: Track count
- Code quality trend: Improving (fewer issues over time)

**Example Workflow**:

```
Day 1 (Monday):
1. architect starts work day
2. enforce_cfr_011() runs automatically
3. Finds 2 new code-searcher reports
4. BLOCKS spec creation with: "CFR-011 VIOLATION: Must read 2 new reports"
5. architect runs: architect daily-integration
6. Reads reports, extracts 5 refactoring opportunities
7. Creates SPEC-054 (refactoring) based on findings
8. Updates SPEC-030 with new patterns identified
9. Tracking updated: last_code_searcher_read = 2025-10-17
10. Now allowed to create new specs

Day 8 (Monday):
1. architect starts work day
2. enforce_cfr_011() runs automatically
3. Finds 7 days since last codebase analysis
4. BLOCKS spec creation with: "CFR-011 VIOLATION: 7 days since analysis"
5. architect runs: architect analyze-codebase
6. Analyzes: large files (5 found), duplicate code (12 instances), test gaps (8 modules)
7. Creates analysis report: docs/architecture/CODEBASE_ANALYSIS_2025-10-17.md
8. Creates 3 refactoring priorities in ROADMAP
9. Tracking updated: last_codebase_analysis = 2025-10-17
10. Now allowed to create new specs
```

**Reference Implementation** (from CFR-011):

```python
class ArchitectDailyRoutine:
    """Enforces CFR-011 daily integration workflow."""

    def __init__(self):
        self.last_code_searcher_read = self._load_last_read_date()
        self.last_codebase_analysis = self._load_last_analysis_date()

    def enforce_cfr_011(self):
        """Mandatory daily check before architect can create new specs."""
        today = datetime.now().date()

        # Part 1: code-searcher report reading
        if self.last_code_searcher_read < today:
            reports = self._find_new_code_searcher_reports()
            if reports and not self._has_read_reports(reports):
                raise CFR011ViolationError(

### US-055: Claude Skills Integration - Phase 1 (Foundation + High-Value Skills)

**PRIORITY**: 17 (HIGH - Infrastructure + 60-70% Time Savings)

**Status**: 🔄 In Progress - HIGH PRIORITY ⭐

**Created**: 2025-10-17

**Estimated Effort**: 4 weeks (84-104 hours)

**User Story**:
As an autonomous agent, I want to use Claude Skills for complex multi-step workflows, so that I can reduce implementation time by 60-70% while maintaining multi-AI provider support through hybrid architecture.

**Problem Statement**:
Current prompt-based system works well for creative reasoning but is inefficient for:
- Complex multi-step workflows (refactoring, testing, DoD verification)
- Executable code tasks (security audits, dependency analysis)
- Automated verification (browser testing, test running, evidence capture)
- Composable workflows (combining multiple tools seamlessly)

**Skills offer:**
- Executable code + AI reasoning combined
- 60-70% time reduction for complex priorities
- Automated verification and testing
- Composable, reusable workflows
- On-demand loading (helps CFR-007 context budget)

**Architecture Approach**:
Skills **complement** prompts (not replace):
- **Prompts** = Multi-provider support (Gemini, OpenAI) + creative reasoning
- **Skills** = Claude-specific automation + executable workflows
- **Hybrid mode** = Best of both worlds

**Phase 1 Deliverables**:

1. **Infrastructure** (Week 1):
   - ✅ **Code Execution Tool AVAILABLE** (Public Beta - no approval needed!)
   - Enable Code Execution Tool with `anthropic-beta: code-execution-2025-08-25` header

### US-058: Architect Skills System - Commit Review & Refactoring Analysis

**Status**: ✅ Complete - Integrated into agents

**Created**: 2025-10-18

**Completed**: 2025-10-18

**Estimated Effort**: 2 days (12-16 hours)

**Actual Effort**: 1.5 days (12 hours)

**User Story**:
As an architect agent, I want to review all code_developer commits and perform proactive refactoring analysis, so that I can maintain architectural consistency, prevent technical debt, and ensure code quality through systematic code reviews.

**Problem Statement**:
The architect agent was passive - it only created specs when requested. It should proactively:
1. Review every commit from code_developer to ensure architectural consistency
2. Identify refactoring opportunities before they become technical debt
3. Provide three types of feedback: tactical (bugs), learning (patterns), strategic (refactoring)
4. Always check existing architecture before proposing new solutions

**Solution Implemented**:

**1. Skill Loader Infrastructure** (`coffee_maker/autonomous/skill_loader.py`):
   - Load skills from `.claude/skills/` directory
   - Variable substitution using `$VARIABLE_NAME` format
   - `SkillNames` enum for type safety
   - `get_available_skills()` for skill discovery

**2. Two Core Skills Created**:

   **Architecture Reuse Check** (`.claude/skills/architecture-reuse-check.md`):
   - MANDATORY before every technical specification
   - Evaluates 12 architectural domains for existing components
   - Fitness scoring (0-100%): >90% REUSE, 70-89% EXTEND, 50-69% ADAPT, <50% NEW
   - Prevents duplicate infrastructure (e.g., proposing git hooks when orchestrator exists)
   - 2000+ lines with comprehensive decision trees

   **Proactive Refactoring Analysis** (`.claude/skills/proactive-refactoring-analysis.md`):
   - Weekly automatic execution (every Monday)
   - Analyzes 7 areas: duplication, complexity, tests, debt, patterns, documentation, dependencies
   - Generates synthetic 1-2 page reports with Top 3 priorities by ROI
   - Reports sent to project_manager for ROADMAP insertion
   - 2500+ lines with detailed analysis frameworks

**3. Architect Agent Integration** (`architect_skills_mixin.py`):
   - `_process_commit_reviews()`: Process commit review requests (CRITICAL first, then up to 3 NORMAL)
   - `_run_refactoring_analysis()`: Weekly automatic analysis (Monday + >7 days since last)
   - `_review_single_commit()`: Analyze individual commits with LLM
   - `_route_commit_feedback()`: Route to tactical/learning/strategic channels
   - `_run_architecture_reuse_check_before_spec()`: MANDATORY before spec creation
   - 650+ lines of orchestration logic

**4. Code Developer Agent Integration** (`code_developer_commit_review_mixin.py`):
   - `_after_commit_success()`: Send review requests after each commit
   - `_determine_review_priority()`: CRITICAL if security/infrastructure/>500 LOC, otherwise NORMAL
   - `_count_loc_changes()`: Count LOC added/removed
   - `_process_tactical_feedback()`: Handle feedback from architect
   - 250+ lines of commit integration logic

**5. Agent Class Integration**:
   - `ArchitectAgent`: Inherited `ArchitectSkillsMixin`, integrated all workflow methods
   - `CodeDeveloperAgent`: Inherited `CodeDeveloperCommitReviewMixin`, overrode `commit_changes()`
   - Both agents now fully integrated with skills system

**6. Documentation Created**:
   - `docs/IMPLEMENTATION_SKILLS_SYSTEM.md`: Complete implementation guide (475 lines)
   - `docs/architecture/REUSABLE_COMPONENTS.md`: Inventory of 12 existing components (1200+ lines)
   - `docs/architecture/ARCHITECT_SKILLS_SUMMARY.md`: Skills overview (800+ lines)
   - `docs/architecture/COMMIT_REVIEW_TRIGGER_COMPARISON.md`: Orchestrator vs git hooks (1000+ lines)
   - `docs/architecture/ARCHITECT_COMMIT_REVIEW_WORKFLOW.md`: Complete workflow (1500+ lines)
   - `docs/architecture/decisions/ADR-009-retire-code-searcher-replace-with-skills.md`
   - `docs/architecture/decisions/ADR-010-code-architect-commit-review-skills-maintenance.md`
   - `docs/architecture/decisions/ADR-011-orchestrator-based-commit-review.md`

**7. Unit Tests** (`tests/unit/test_skill_loader.py`):
   - 8 tests covering skill loading, variable substitution, availability, content integrity
   - All tests passing

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [x] Skill loader infrastructure implemented and tested
- [x] Architecture reuse check skill created (MANDATORY before specs)
- [x] Proactive refactoring analysis skill created (weekly automatic)
- [x] Architect agent integrated with commit review workflow
- [x] Code developer agent sends commit review requests after commits
- [x] Three feedback channels operational (tactical/learning/strategic)
- [x] Orchestrator messaging used (not git hooks - 100% architecture reuse!)
- [x] Priority-based commit queue (CRITICAL before NORMAL)
- [x] Weekly refactoring analysis automated (Monday execution)
- [x] Comprehensive documentation created (8 files, 8000+ lines)
- [x] Unit tests passing (8/8 tests)
- [x] All changes committed (commit b754f27)

**Implementation Summary**:
- **20 files changed**: 10,748 insertions, 16 deletions
- **2 skills created**: 4,500+ lines total
- **3 Python modules**: 900+ lines (skill_loader + 2 mixins)
- **8 documentation files**: 8,000+ lines
- **1 test file**: 150+ lines
- **Total**: 14 new files, 13,550+ lines

**Key Insight**:
The git hooks mistake (initially proposed, then corrected to use orchestrator messaging) became the foundational example in the architecture-reuse-check skill. This demonstrates the self-improving nature of the system - past mistakes inform future architectural decisions.

**Workflow Now Operational**:
```
code_developer commits code
    ↓
Calls _after_commit_success()
    ↓
Determines priority (CRITICAL if security/infrastructure/>500 LOC)
    ↓
Sends commit_review_request message to architect
    ↓
architect (next background work iteration):
    ↓
_process_commit_reviews() reads inbox
    ↓
Processes CRITICAL first, then up to 3 NORMAL
    ↓
_review_single_commit() analyzes with LLM
    ↓
_route_commit_feedback() sends tactical/learning/strategic messages
    ↓
code_developer/_process_tactical_feedback() receives and logs feedback
```

**Weekly Refactoring Analysis**:
```
Monday (architect background work)
    ↓
_should_run_refactoring_analysis() checks if >7 days since last
    ↓
_run_refactoring_analysis() executes
    ↓
Loads proactive-refactoring-analysis skill
    ↓
Generates synthetic 1-2 page report
    ↓
Saves to docs/architecture/refactoring_analysis_YYYYMMDD.md
    ↓
Sends report to project_manager
```

**Architecture Reuse Check (MANDATORY)**:
```
architect creates spec for PRIORITY X
    ↓
_create_spec_for_priority() calls:
    ↓
_run_architecture_reuse_check_before_spec()
    ↓
Loads architecture-reuse-check skill
    ↓
Evaluates existing components (0-100% fitness)
    ↓
Returns reuse analysis
    ↓
Spec includes "## 🔍 Architecture Reuse Check" section
```

### US-056: Enforce CFR-013 - Daemon Must Work on roadmap Branch Only

**Status**: ✅ COMPLETE

**Created**: 2025-10-17

**Completed**: 2025-10-17

**Estimated Effort**: 2-3 hours (Actual: 1.5 hours)

**User Story**:
As a user, I want the code_developer daemon to work directly on the `roadmap` branch, so that all autonomous work follows CFR-013 and avoids branch-related errors.

**Problem Statement**:
The code_developer daemon currently violates CFR-013 by attempting to create feature branches:

**Current Behavior (VIOLATION)**:
```python
# daemon_implementation.py:198
branch_name = f"feature/{priority_name.lower().replace(' ', '-').replace(':', '')}"
logger.info(f"Creating branch: {branch_name}")
if not self.git.create_branch(branch_name):
    logger.error("Failed to create branch")
    return False
```

**Error Encountered**:
```
Failed to create branch: erreur : Vos modifications locales...
```

**Why This Blocks Daemon**:
- Daemon tries to create `feature/us-056-...` branch
- Git rejects because there are uncommitted changes
- CFR-013 requires ALL work on `roadmap` branch only
- NO feature branches allowed for ANY agent

This is a **Critical Functional Requirement** (CFR-013) violation that completely blocks autonomous daemon operations.

**Description**:
Remove all feature branch creation logic from code_developer daemon and update it to work directly on the `roadmap` branch. All commits should go straight to `roadmap` with frequent, clear commit messages.

**Requirements**:

1. **Remove Feature Branch Creation**:
   - Delete lines 198-204 in `daemon_implementation.py` (branch creation logic)
   - Delete branch name generation logic
   - Remove `self.git.create_branch()` call
   - Remove related status reporting for branch creation

2. **Work Directly on roadmap Branch**:
   - Ensure daemon is on `roadmap` branch at startup
   - Add validation: Check current branch is `roadmap` before any work
   - Raise clear error if not on `roadmap` branch
   - Stay on `roadmap` throughout entire daemon lifecycle

3. **Update Git Operations**:
   - Remove branch pushing logic (no separate branches to push)
   - Keep commit logic (commits go to `roadmap` directly)
   - Update push to: `git push origin roadmap`
   - No more `git push -u origin feature/...`

4. **Add CFR-013 Validation**:
   - Add `validate_cfr_013()` method to daemon startup
   - Check: `git branch --show-current` == "roadmap"
   - Raise `CFR013ViolationError` if on wrong branch
   - Clear error message with instructions

5. **Update Pull Request Creation**:
   - PRs are created FROM `roadmap` TO `main` (if PRs still desired)
   - Or disable PR creation entirely (work stays on `roadmap` until manual merge)
   - Update PR body to reference `roadmap` branch
   - Consider if PRs are even needed in single-branch workflow

6. **Update Status Reporting**:
   - Remove "Creating branch" progress step
   - Update activity logging (no branch creation events)
   - Log commits directly to `roadmap` instead
   - Simplify progress reporting

7. **Update Prompts**:
   - Review `.claude/commands/implement-feature.md`
   - Review `.claude/commands/implement-documentation.md`
   - Ensure prompts don't mention feature branches
   - Clarify work happens on `roadmap` branch

8. **Documentation Updates**:
   - Update CLAUDE.md "Git Workflow" section (already updated with CFR-013)
   - Update daemon documentation
   - Add CFR-013 reference to code_developer agent docs
   - Update any diagrams showing branch workflow

**Acceptance Criteria**:

- [ ] code_developer daemon works ONLY on `roadmap` branch
- [ ] NO feature branch creation logic remains
- [ ] Daemon validates it's on `roadmap` at startup
- [ ] Clear error if daemon starts on wrong branch
- [ ] All commits go directly to `roadmap`
- [ ] Push operations target `origin roadmap`
- [ ] Status reporting updated (no branch creation step)
- [ ] PR creation updated or disabled appropriately
- [ ] Prompts don't reference feature branches
- [ ] Documentation reflects single-branch workflow
- [ ] CFR-013 compliance verified
- [ ] Daemon can run without branch-related errors

**Correct Workflow (After Implementation)**:

```bash
# Daemon startup
1. Check current branch: git branch --show-current
2. If not "roadmap": STOP with clear error
3. If "roadmap": Continue

# Implementation cycle
4. Pull latest: git pull origin roadmap
5. Make changes directly on roadmap
6. Commit frequently: git commit -m "feat: Progress on US-056"
7. Push to roadmap: git push origin roadmap
8. Repeat for next priority (stay on roadmap!)

# NO branch creation
# NO git checkout -b feature/...
# NO separate branches
```

**Implementation Changes**:

**BEFORE (CFR-013 VIOLATION)**:
```python
# Create branch
branch_name = f"feature/{priority_name.lower()...}"
if not self.git.create_branch(branch_name):
    return False

# ... work ...

# Push feature branch
if not self.git.push():  # pushes feature/* branch
    return False
```

**AFTER (CFR-013 COMPLIANT)**:
```python
# Validate we're on roadmap
self._validate_cfr_013()  # Raises if not on roadmap

# Work directly on roadmap (no branch creation!)
# ... make changes ...

# Commit to roadmap
if not self.git.commit(commit_message):
    return False

# Push roadmap
if not self.git.push("roadmap"):  # explicit: push to roadmap
    return False
```

**Error Messages**:

```
CFR-013 VIOLATION: code_developer must work on roadmap branch

Current branch: main
Required branch: roadmap

CFR-013 requires ALL agents to work on roadmap branch ONLY.
Creating feature branches is FORBIDDEN.

To fix:
1. git checkout roadmap
2. Restart daemon

Reason: Single source of truth, prevents branch conflicts, simplifies coordination.
```

**Benefits**:

1. **Unblocks Daemon**: Daemon can operate without branch errors
2. **CFR-013 Compliance**: Follows critical functional requirement
3. **Simplifies Workflow**: Less git complexity, fewer failure points
4. **Team Visibility**: All work immediately visible on `roadmap`
5. **No Merge Conflicts**: Single branch eliminates branch merge issues
6. **Faster Iteration**: No branch creation/switching overhead
7. **Easier Rollback**: Single branch history simplifies reverting

**Dependencies**:
- CFR-013 must be documented (already done in CRITICAL_FUNCTIONAL_REQUIREMENTS.md)
- CLAUDE.md already updated with single-branch workflow

**Technical Specification Required**: No - straightforward refactoring (remove branch logic, add validation)

**Estimated Changes**:
- `daemon_implementation.py`: Remove 10 lines, add 5 lines (validation)
- `git_manager.py`: Update push method to accept branch name
- Documentation: Update references (minimal)
- Prompts: Review and update (minimal)

**Priority Level**: 🚨 CRITICAL - BLOCKS ALL AUTONOMOUS WORK

### US-057: Transform Daemon into Multi-Agent Orchestrator (Parallel Team Execution)

**Status**: ✅ PHASE 1 COMPLETE - All 7 Agents Created (Foundation Ready for Testing)

**Priority**: HIGH (Foundation for true autonomous team operation)

**Estimated Effort**: 3 weeks (major architectural refactor)

**Created**: 2025-10-17

**Prerequisites**:
- US-056: Enforce CFR-013 (Daemon on roadmap branch only) 🚨 REQUIRED

**User Story**:
As a user, I want ALL agents (architect, code_developer, project_manager, assistant, code-searcher, ux-design-expert) to run simultaneously in parallel, so that work happens 3-6x faster through coordinated team collaboration.

**Problem Statement**:

The current code_developer daemon architecture creates artificial bottlenecks through sequential execution:

**Current (Sequential - 9 hours)**:
```
code_developer daemon (single agent):
1. Wait for spec         → 2 hours (blocking)
2. Implement             → 4 hours (sequential)
3. Wait for demo         → 1 hour (manual request)
4. Fix bug               → 2 hours (reactive)
Total: 9 hours per priority
```

**Proposed (Parallel - 4 hours)**:

Multi-Agent Orchestrator (6 agents simultaneously):
architect ────────► Creating specs (proactive, CFR-011)
code_developer ───► Implementing (never blocked)
assistant ────────► Creating demos (automatic)
project_manager ──► Monitoring GitHub (continuous)
code-searcher ────► Analyzing codebase (weekly)
ux-design-expert ─► Reviewing UI/UX (as needed)
Total: 4 hours per priority (2.25x faster)
```

**Description**:

Transform the current single-agent daemon into a **Multi-Agent Orchestrator** that launches and manages ALL agents working simultaneously as a coordinated autonomous team. Each agent runs continuously in its own subprocess, executing its responsibilities in parallel with other agents.

**Key Vision**: Move from "single developer" to "autonomous team" - multiple agents collaborating like a human team would, with specialization, delegation, and coordination.

**Architecture Overview**:

8. **Priority completion time reduced by 50%** (3-6x speedup: 9 hours → 4 hours measured)
9. **System runs 24 hours without intervention** (full autonomy demonstrated)
10. **User feedback: "This feels like a real team working together"** (qualitative validation)

**Related Work**:

**Prerequisites**:
- US-056: Enforce CFR-013 (Daemon on roadmap branch only) 🚨 REQUIRED

**Builds On**:
- US-045: Daemon delegates spec creation to architect
- US-027: Roadmap branch as single source of truth
- US-024: Frequent roadmap sync
- US-035: Agent singleton enforcement (CFR-000)
- CFR-011: Architect proactive spec creation
- CFR-012: Agent responsiveness priority
- CFR-013: All agents on roadmap branch

**Enables**:
- US-058+: Future priorities implemented 3-6x faster
- Continuous QA with automatic demos
- Proactive architecture with specs always ready
- Real-time project monitoring
- Weekly codebase improvements
- True autonomous team operation

**Technical Specification**: See /Users/bobain/PycharmProjects/MonolithicCoffeeMakerAgent/docs/roadmap/US_057_MULTI_AGENT_ORCHESTRATOR.md

**Estimated Timeline**: 3 weeks (15 working days)

**Expected Impact**: 🚀 TRANSFORMATIONAL (3-6x speedup, true team autonomy)

**Rationale**:
- **Blocking Issue**: Daemon cannot currently operate due to CFR-013 violation
- **Critical Requirement**: CFR-013 is a system invariant that must be enforced
- **High Impact**: Unblocks ALL future autonomous development work
- **Low Risk**: Simplifies rather than complicates (removing code)
- **Quick Fix**: 2-3 hours to implement and test

**Related Documents**:
- `docs/roadmap/CRITICAL_FUNCTIONAL_REQUIREMENTS.md` - CFR-013 full definition
- `.claude/CLAUDE.md` - Single-branch workflow already documented
- `coffee_maker/autonomous/daemon_implementation.py` - Code that needs fixing (line 198)
- `docs/architecture/guidelines/GUIDELINE-004-git-tagging-strategy.md` - Git tagging on roadmap branch

**Unblocks**:
- ALL future autonomous daemon work
- All pending priorities waiting for code_developer
- Continuous autonomous development

**Blocked By**: None (can implement immediately)

**Notes**:
This is the highest priority fix needed right now. Without this, the code_developer daemon cannot operate autonomously at all. The fix is straightforward (remove feature branch logic, add validation) and low risk (simplifies the workflow rather than adding complexity).

**Success Metrics**:
- Daemon starts successfully: 100%
- Daemon stays on roadmap branch: 100%
- No branch-related errors: 0 errors
- All commits go to roadmap: 100%
- CFR-013 compliance: Full compliance

### US-061: Architect + Project_Manager: Design Decision on Reflector & Curator Agent-to-Skill Conversion

**Status**: ✅ APPROVED - READY FOR IMPLEMENTATION ⭐⭐⭐

**Created**: 2025-10-18

**Approved**: 2025-10-18 (User approval obtained)

**Decision**: **Reflector and Curator REMAIN AS AGENTS** (ADR-010 approved by user)

**Estimated Effort**: 8-12 hours (collaborative analysis + ADR creation)

**User Story**:
As a system architect and project manager, we need to analyze whether Reflector and Curator agents should be converted to skills (like generator was), so that we can optimize the ACE framework architecture based on data-driven analysis.

**Problem Statement**:

**Recent Success**:
- Generator agent successfully converted to trace-execution skill
- Benefits observed: reduced complexity, better observability, on-demand loading
- Freed up agent slot for more active agents

**Critical Question**:
Should Reflector and Curator follow the same pattern (agent → skill)?

**Or are they fundamentally different?**

**Analysis Required**:

**1. Compare Generator vs. Reflector vs. Curator**:

**Generator (✅ Became trace-execution skill)**:
- Function: Capture execution traces
- Frequency: Every agent action (very frequent)
- Autonomy: Reactive (no independent decisions)
- State: Stateless (just capture and save)
- Interaction: No inter-agent communication needed

**Reflector (❓ Agent or Skill?)**:
- Function: Extract insights from traces
- Frequency: Periodic (weekly or on-demand)
- Autonomy: Semi-autonomous (analyzes patterns, generates insights)
- State: Maintains insight history
- Interaction: Reads traces, writes delta items

**Curator (❓ Agent or Skill?)**:
- Function: Maintain evolving playbooks from insights
- Frequency: Periodic (weekly or on-demand)
- Autonomy: Highly autonomous (curates knowledge, evolves playbooks)
- State: Maintains playbook versions, evolution history
- Interaction: Reads deltas, writes playbooks, informs architecture

**2. Evaluation Criteria**:

For each (Reflector, Curator), analyze:

**Benefits of Skill Conversion**:
- Reduced complexity (fewer agents to orchestrate)
- On-demand loading (context budget improvement)
- Simplified deployment (no separate process)
- Easier maintenance (single codebase)
- Better integration (direct function calls)

**Benefits of Staying Agent**:
- Autonomous operation (runs independently)
- Persistent state (maintains history)
- Background processing (doesn't block other agents)
- Inter-agent communication (messages, notifications)
- Scheduled execution (weekly automatic runs)

**3. Architect Analysis Focus**:

**Architect investigates**:
- System architecture implications
- Component composition and reuse
- Skill vs. agent patterns in codebase
- Technical complexity of conversion
- Maintenance burden comparison
- Integration with existing skills/agents

**4. Project_Manager Analysis Focus**:

**project_manager investigates**:
- Operational complexity (orchestration)
- Observability requirements
- Deployment and scaling considerations
- User experience impact (how users invoke)
- Cost considerations (API usage, resources)
- Timeline for potential conversion

**5. Joint Decision Framework**:

**Decision Matrix**:
```
                  | Generator | Reflector | Curator
------------------+-----------+-----------+--------
Frequency         | Very High | Medium    | Low
Autonomy          | None      | Medium    | High
State Required    | No        | Yes       | Yes
Inter-Agent Comm  | No        | Limited   | Extensive
Background Work   | No        | Yes       | Yes
------------------+-----------+-----------+--------
Recommendation    | SKILL ✅   | ?         | ?
```

**Requirements**:

1. **Reflector Analysis**:
   - Analyze current reflector implementation
   - Identify: Stateful vs. stateless components
   - Evaluate: Could reflector work as on-demand skill?
   - Consider: Loses what capabilities if converted to skill?
   - Assess: Technical complexity of conversion

2. **Curator Analysis**:
   - Analyze current curator implementation
   - Identify: Autonomous behaviors that require agent status
   - Evaluate: Could curator work as on-demand skill?
   - Consider: Playbook evolution still possible as skill?
   - Assess: Impact on ACE framework effectiveness

3. **Comparison to Generator**:
   - Document: What made generator ideal for skill conversion
   - Compare: Do reflector/curator share same characteristics?
   - Identify: Key differences that matter for decision
   - Analyze: Generator conversion lessons learned

4. **Collaborative Decision Process**:
   - architect: Technical architecture recommendation
   - project_manager: Operational and strategic recommendation
   - Joint discussion: Resolve any conflicts
   - Consensus: Final recommendation with rationale

5. **Deliverable: ADR (Architectural Decision Record)**:
   - Title: "ADR-0XX: Reflector and Curator - Agent vs. Skill Decision"
   - Context: Current ACE architecture, generator conversion
   - Decision: Keep as agents OR convert to skills (with clear rationale)

**Started**: 2025-10-18
**Target Completion**: 2025-11-15 (4 weeks)
**Business Value**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ CRITICAL - Force multiplier for ALL future work

### Phase 0 Overview

**WHY PHASE 0 COMES FIRST**:
Phase 0 is the "force multiplier" that makes ALL subsequent work 3-5x faster. By investing 3-4 weeks upfront to build the skills infrastructure, we accelerate EVERYTHING else:

**The Force Multiplier Effect**:
- **Without Phase 0**: 4-6 weeks for Phases 1-3 at baseline velocity
- **With Phase 0**: 3-4 weeks Phase 0, then 1.5-2 weeks for Phases 1-3 at 3-5x velocity
- **Net Result**: Total time SHORTER despite upfront investment
- **Ongoing Benefit**: All future work continues at 3-5x velocity

### Phase 0 Success Metrics

**Before Phase 0**:
- Code analysis: 10-30 seconds per search (code-searcher agent)
- code_developer velocity: Baseline (1.0x)
- architect spec creation: 117 minutes per spec
- Context budget violations: 40-60 per month
- Monthly agent overhead: 120-180 hours

**After Phase 0**:
- Code analysis: <200ms per search (skills) **50-150x faster**
- code_developer velocity: +200-400% **3-5x faster**
- architect spec creation: 25 minutes per spec **78% faster**
- Context budget violations: 0 per month **100% compliance**
- Monthly time savings: 80-120 hours **67% overhead reduction**

**ROI Calculation**:
- Month 1: 82-112 hrs investment → 80-120 hrs saved = 0.7-1.5x ROI
- Month 2: 0 hrs investment → 80-120 hrs saved = ∞ ROI
- Year 1: 82-112 hrs investment → 960-1440 hrs saved = 9-17x ROI

### US-050: Architect Creates POCs for Complex Implementations

**PRIORITY**: 16 (HIGH - Quality & Risk Reduction)

**Status**: 📝 Planned - HIGH PRIORITY (Quality & Risk Reduction)

**Created**: 2025-10-18

**Estimated Effort**: Varies by task (1-4 hours per POC)

**User Story**:
As the architect agent, I want to create a Proof of Concept (POC) implementation for complex tasks on top of technical specifications, so that code_developer has a working reference implementation and we reduce implementation risk for difficult features.

**Problem Statement**:
Currently, architect creates comprehensive technical specs, but for complex tasks:
- **No working code reference**: code_developer must figure out implementation details from scratch
- **Higher implementation risk**: Complex features may have hidden complexity not visible in specs
- **Longer implementation time**: code_developer spends time exploring approaches that architect could validate upfront
- **Potential for misinterpretation**: Specs may be ambiguous without concrete code examples

**Description**:
For complex tasks (estimated effort > 2 days OR technical complexity = High), architect creates a minimal Proof of Concept implementation alongside the technical spec. This POC serves as:
1. **Reference implementation** - Shows exactly how components should work
2. **Risk validation** - Proves the approach is feasible before full implementation
3. **API validation** - Validates interface designs with working code
4. **Implementation guide** - Provides concrete examples for code_developer

**Requirements**:

1. **POC Criteria** (When to create):
   - Estimated effort > 2 days (16+ hours)
   - Technical complexity = High
   - Novel architectural patterns (not used before)
   - Integration with external systems (GitHub API, Puppeteer, etc.)
   - Performance-critical components (caching, rate limiting, etc.)

2. **POC Scope** (What to include):
   - Minimal implementation of core components (20-30% of full implementation)
   - Working examples of key interfaces/APIs
   - Integration points validated (external APIs, databases, etc.)
   - Critical path proven (hardest part working)
   - Comments explaining architectural decisions

3. **POC Location**:
   - Save to: `docs/architecture/pocs/POC-{number}-{feature-slug}/`
   - Structure:
     ```
     docs/architecture/pocs/POC-072-team-daemon/
       ├── README.md           # POC overview, how to run, what it proves
       ├── team_daemon.py      # Minimal TeamDaemon implementation
       ├── agent_process.py    # Minimal AgentProcess wrapper
       ├── message_queue.py    # Minimal MessageQueue (SQLite)
       └── test_poc.py         # Tests proving POC works
     ```

4. **POC Documentation**:
   - README.md explains:
     - What this POC proves (specific risks validated)
     - How to run it (commands, dependencies)
     - What's NOT included (out of scope)
     - How code_developer should use it (reference, not copy-paste)
   - Code comments explain:
     - Architectural decisions (why this approach)
     - Simplifications made (what's omitted vs full implementation)
     - Integration points (how to connect to real systems)

5. **POC Delivery**:
   - Created BEFORE code_developer starts implementation
   - Committed alongside technical spec
   - Referenced in spec (link to POC directory)
   - Reviewed with user if POC reveals new complexity

6. **Integration with Workflow**:
   - architect creates spec → determines if POC needed → creates POC if complex
   - code_developer reads spec + POC → implements full version
   - POC remains as reference (not merged into production)

**Acceptance Criteria**:

- [ ] architect evaluates complexity for every new spec
- [ ] POCs created for all complex tasks (effort > 2 days OR complexity = High)
- [ ] Each POC includes working code + tests + README
- [ ] POC validates critical path (hardest parts proven)
- [ ] POC committed alongside spec (same PR/commit)
- [ ] code_developer references POC during implementation
- [ ] POCs documented in docs/architecture/pocs/README.md
- [ ] Metrics tracked: % of complex tasks with POCs, time saved

**Example POCs**:

1. **POC-072-team-daemon**: Multi-agent orchestration
   - Proves: Subprocess management, message queue, health monitoring
   - Scope: Spawn 2 agents, send 1 message, detect 1 crash
   - Time: 2-3 hours

2. **POC-048-notification-enforcement**: CFR-009 sound enforcement
   - Proves: Validation logic works, errors raised correctly
   - Scope: Mock NotificationDB, test 3 scenarios
   - Time: 1 hour

3. **POC-049-review-triggers**: File-based review detection
   - Proves: File mtime detection, trigger accuracy
   - Scope: Create/modify files, test trigger detection
   - Time: 1-2 hours

**Benefits**:

- **Risk Reduction**: Validate approach before full implementation (30-50% risk reduction)
- **Faster Implementation**: code_developer has working reference (20-30% time savings)
- **Better Quality**: POC catches design issues early (fewer post-implementation refactors)
- **Knowledge Transfer**: POC documents architectural intent in code
- **Confidence**: User sees working prototype before full implementation

**Time Investment vs Savings**:

- **POC Creation Time**: 1-4 hours (10-20% of implementation time)
- **Implementation Time Saved**: 20-30% (code_developer has reference)
- **Refactoring Time Saved**: 50-70% (fewer design issues caught late)
- **ROI**: 2-3x return (invest 2 hours, save 4-6 hours)

**When NOT to Create POC**:

- Simple tasks (effort < 2 days)
- Well-understood patterns (used many times before)
- Straightforward CRUD operations
- Documentation-only changes
- Test-only changes

**Estimated Effort**: 1-4 hours per POC (varies by complexity)

**Dependencies**: None (can start immediately)

**Technical Specification Required**: No (this is a process change, not a technical implementation)

**Priority Level**: HIGH

**Rationale**:
- Reduces implementation risk for complex features
- Validates architectural decisions with working code
- Accelerates code_developer implementation (reference implementation)
- Improves quality (catches design issues early)
- CFR-010 compatible (continuous improvement includes POC creation)

**Related Documents**:
- CFR-008: Architect-Only Spec Creation
- CFR-010: Continuous Spec Improvement
- ADR-003: Simplification-First Approach
- SPEC-071: Architect-Only Spec Creation
- SPEC-072: Multi-Agent Orchestration Daemon (candidate for first POC)

**Unblocks**: Complex implementations (SPEC-072, future complex specs)

**Blocked By**: None

**Notes**:
This adds a new responsibility to architect: create POCs for complex tasks. This is a best practice in software architecture - validate risky decisions with working prototypes before committing to full implementation.

POCs are NOT production code - they're reference implementations that prove feasibility and guide code_developer. They should be minimal (20-30% of full implementation) and focused on proving the hardest parts work.

## US-105: Development Acceleration Insights Dashboard

**Priority**: PRIORITY 21 (HIGH - User Request)

**Status**: 📝 Planned

**Created**: 2025-10-19

**Estimated Effort**: 1-2 days

**User Story**:
As a user, I want a comprehensive Streamlit dashboard showing development bottlenecks, task durations, and acceleration opportunities (like adding a second developer or new skills), with curator insights displayed alongside, so that I can make informed decisions to increase development velocity.

**Problem Statement**:
Without visibility into development metrics and bottlenecks, we cannot:
- Identify what is slowing down progress

## US-106: Code-Reviewer Agent for Quality Assurance

**Priority**: PRIORITY 22 (HIGH - User Request - Quality Loop)

**Status**: 📝 Planned

**Created**: 2025-10-19

**Estimated Effort**: 3-4 days

**User Story**:
As the system, I want a code-reviewer agent that reviews all code modified by code_developer and writes conclusions for architect to read, so that architect can request implementation changes via technical spec updates, ensuring continuous quality improvement.

**Problem Statement**:
Currently, code_developer implements features without automated quality review:
- No systematic code review process
- Architecture violations may go unnoticed
- Best practices not consistently enforced
- architect only sees code issues if manually checking
- No feedback loop for continuous improvement

**Agent Role**: code-reviewer

**Agent Responsibilities**:

1. **Automated Code Review**:
   - Monitor commits from code_developer
   - Review changed files automatically
   - Apply quality checks (architecture, patterns, best practices)
   - Generate review reports

2. **Quality Analysis**:
   - Architecture compliance (follows specs, ADRs, guidelines)
   - Code patterns (DRY, SOLID, design patterns)
   - Security vulnerabilities
   - Performance concerns
   - Test coverage adequacy
   - Documentation completeness

3. **Architect Communication**:
   - Write review conclusions to `docs/code-reviews/REVIEW-{date}-{commit}.md`
   - Highlight issues requiring architect attention
   - Suggest spec improvements based on implementation learnings
   - Track unresolved issues

4. **Feedback Loop**:
   - architect reads reviews
   - architect updates technical specs with improvements
   - code_developer implements changes
   - code-reviewer verifies fixes

**Workflow**:

```
1. code_developer commits code
   ↓
2. code-reviewer (triggered automatically):
   - git diff to see changes
   - Analyze changed files
   - Run quality checks
   - Generate review report
   ↓
3. code-reviewer writes to docs/code-reviews/REVIEW-{commit}.md:
   - Summary of changes
   - Quality score (0-100)
   - Issues found (Critical/High/Medium/Low)
   - Architecture compliance assessment
   - Recommendations for architect
   ↓
4. code-reviewer notifies architect (high-priority notification)
   ↓
5. architect reads review:
   - If OK: Approves (no action)
   - If issues: Updates technical spec with corrections
   - Creates follow-up task for code_developer
   ↓
6. code_developer implements corrections
   ↓
7. code-reviewer re-reviews (verification cycle)
```

**Review Report Format** (`docs/code-reviews/REVIEW-{commit}.md`):

```markdown
# Code Review Report

**Commit**: abc1234
**Date**: 2025-10-19
