## Work Streams

### Stream 1: code_developer - Build & Test Acceleration üî¥ CRITICAL

**Owner**: code_developer
**Status**: üìù Planned (Work begins 2025-10-21)
**ETA**: 2025-10-23 (3 days)

**Tasks**:

#### 1.1 Build Cache Optimization (2-3 hrs) ‚ö° HIGHEST ROI
- **Objective**: Reduce Poetry install time from 2-3 min to 30-60 sec per CI job
- **Expected Impact**: 12-16 hrs/month saved
- **ROI**: 16-32x return
- **Technical Approach**:
  - Optimize GitHub Actions caching strategy
  - Configure Poetry virtualenvs in-project
  - Share cached dependencies across jobs
  - Configure incremental black (changed files only)
- **Files to Modify**:
  - `.github/workflows/daemon-test.yml`
  - `.pre-commit-config.yaml`
- **Success Criteria**:
  - Poetry install < 60 seconds (cache hit)
  - Black runs incrementally (< 5 sec)
  - All CI jobs use shared cache
  - Cache hit rate > 80%

#### 1.2 CI/CD Test Parallelization (4-6 hrs) üî¥ CRITICAL
- **Objective**: Reduce CI run time from 15-25 min to 6-10 min per run
- **Expected Impact**: 8-12 hrs/month saved
- **ROI**: 2-4x return
- **Technical Approach**:
  - Refactor daemon-test.yml for parallel matrix execution
  - Run [smoke, unit, integration, coverage] in parallel
  - Optimize test suite splitting
  - Use pytest-xdist for parallel test execution
- **Files to Modify**:
  - `.github/workflows/daemon-test.yml`
  - `pytest.ini` (configure parallel execution)
- **Success Criteria**:
  - CI run time < 10 minutes
  - All tests pass in parallel
  - No race conditions or flaky tests
  - Test matrix shows 4 parallel jobs

#### 1.3 Fix 37 Test Failures (12-15 hrs) ‚ö†Ô∏è BLOCKER
- **Objective**: Achieve 100% test pass rate (currently 97.6%)
- **Current Status**: 1,548 passed, 37 failed
- **Expected Impact**: Unblocks all future development
- **Technical Approach**:
  - Analyze failing tests with test-failure-analysis skill
  - Fix root causes (not symptoms)
  - Add regression tests where needed
  - Update test documentation
- **Success Criteria**:
  - 0 failing tests
  - 100% pass rate
  - All tests stable (no flakiness)
  - CI consistently green

**Total Stream 1 Effort**: 18-24 hours
**Total Stream 1 Impact**: 20-28 hrs/month saved

### Stream 2: architect - Dependency Automation üü† HIGH

**Owner**: architect
**Status**: üìù Planned (Work begins 2025-10-21)
**ETA**: 2025-10-22 (2 days)

**Tasks**:

#### 2.1 Dependency Pre-Approval Matrix (3-4 hrs)
- **Objective**: Reduce dependency approval time from 20 min to 2 min
- **Expected Impact**: 4-6 hrs/month saved
- **ROI**: 1.2x return
- **Technical Approach**:
  - Create `docs/architecture/DEPENDENCY_PRE_APPROVAL_MATRIX.md`
  - Categorize dependencies:
    - Pre-Approved: Auto-approve (pytest, black, mypy, etc.)
    - Standard: Requires justification + user approval
    - Banned: Never approve (GPL, unmaintained, high-CVE)
  - Integrate with dependency-conflict-resolver skill
  - Document approval workflow
- **Files to Create**:
  - `docs/architecture/DEPENDENCY_PRE_APPROVAL_MATRIX.md`
- **Success Criteria**:
  - Matrix includes 20+ pre-approved packages
  - Clear categorization rules
  - Integrated with existing skill
  - architect uses matrix automatically
