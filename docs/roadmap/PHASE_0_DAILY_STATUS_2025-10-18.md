## Blockers

### Active Blockers
**None** âœ…

### Potential Risks (Monitoring)
1. **US-091 Integration Complexity** (LOW)
   - Risk: Integration with daemon may take longer than expected
   - Impact: Could delay US-092, US-093 by 1-2 days
   - Mitigation: Daily check-ins, architect available for design help
   - Status: Monitoring

2. **Skill Adoption Lag** (LOW)
   - Risk: Agents slow to adopt new skills after implementation
   - Impact: Velocity improvement delayed by 1-2 weeks
   - Mitigation: Clear documentation, training period in Week 4
   - Status: Planning

## Velocity Analysis

### This Week (Week 1: Oct 14-18)
- **Stories Completed**: 7 (US-090, dependency-conflict-resolver, code-index, spec-creation-automation, context-budget-optimizer, + 2 others)
- **Time Spent**: ~35-40 hours
- **Velocity**: 1.4 stories/day (7 stories / 5 days)
- **Comparison to Baseline**: 2.8x faster than expected (expected 0.5 stories/week for foundation work)

**Analysis**: Week 1 exceeded expectations. Foundation skills (US-090) plus 3 major acceleration skills complete. Strong momentum.

### Projected Velocity (Weeks 2-4)

**Week 2 (Oct 21-25)**: 3-4 stories
- US-091 (complete integration)
- US-092, US-093 (migrations)
- Begin US-094 (transition validation)

**Week 3 (Oct 28-Nov 1)**: 3-4 stories
- US-062, US-063, US-064 (startup skills)

**Week 4 (Nov 4-8)**: 4-5 stories
- US-065, US-066, US-067 (code_developer acceleration)
- US-068, US-069 (architect acceleration)

**Week 5 (Nov 11-15)**: 2-3 stories
- US-097, US-103, US-102 (final acceleration skills)

**Total Projected**: 12-16 stories over 5 weeks (on track for 16 total)

## Week 1 Retrospective Preview

**What Went Well**:
- Strong velocity (1.4 stories/day vs 0.5 expected)
- High-impact skills completed (spec-creation-automation: 78% faster)
- No blockers encountered
- Good coordination between agents

**What Could Improve**:
- More frequent progress updates (every 4 hours vs 6-12 hours)
- Earlier detection of potential risks
- Better time estimates (some skills took longer than expected)

**Action Items for Week 2**:
1. Daily standup at 9am PST (project_manager generates status)
2. Risk review every 48 hours
3. Dependency check before starting new work
4. Performance benchmarks for all skills (verify time savings claims)
