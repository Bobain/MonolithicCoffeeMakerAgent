## FAQ

### Q: How do I enable ACE for all agents?

**A**: Configuration page (Phase 1) is coming soon. For now, ACE is enabled via code configuration in `coffee_maker/autonomous/ace/config.py`.

---

### Q: Why don't I see any traces on the Monitor page?

**A**: Possible reasons:
1. You haven't run the daemon yet ‚Üí Run `poetry run code-developer --auto-approve`
2. ACE is not enabled for agents ‚Üí Check your ACE configuration
3. Time range is too narrow ‚Üí Try "Last 24 Hours" or "Last Week"
4. Traces directory is empty ‚Üí Check `docs/generator/traces/`

---

### Q: How do I export analytics data?

**A**: For charts:
1. Hover over any chart
2. Click the camera icon (top-right of chart) to download as PNG
3. Or use the menu (three dots) for more export options (CSV, SVG, etc.)

For raw data:
- Currently, raw data export is not implemented (coming in future update)

---

### Q: What does "effectiveness score" mean?

**A**: Effectiveness is a measure of how well a playbook bullet improves agent performance:
- **0.0-0.3** (üî¥): Low effectiveness, consider rejecting
- **0.3-0.7** (üü°): Medium effectiveness, monitor performance
- **0.7-1.0** (üü¢): High effectiveness, keep and promote

Calculated based on:
- Success rate when bullet is used
- User satisfaction (if available)
- Task completion time improvements

---

### Q: Can I use the app on mobile?

**A**: Yes! The app uses responsive design and works on tablets and smartphones. However, for the best experience (especially for analytics charts), we recommend:
- Desktop: 1920x1080 or higher
- Laptop: 1366x768 or higher
- Tablet: 768x1024 (portrait or landscape)
- Mobile: 375x667 (basic navigation, limited chart interaction)

---

### Q: How often should I curate playbooks?

**A**: Recommended schedule:
- **Daily**: Check Curation Queue (5 minutes)
- **Weekly**: Review pending bullets per agent (10-15 minutes per agent)
- **Monthly**: Deep review of all bullets, especially low-effectiveness ones (1-2 hours)

---

### Q: What's the difference between Monitor and Analytics?

**A**:
- **Monitor**: Real-time, trace-level detail, operational monitoring, debugging
- **Analytics**: Historical trends, aggregated metrics, strategic insights, optimization

Use Monitor for "What's happening NOW?" and Analytics for "How are we doing OVER TIME?"

---

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: App won't start

**Symptoms**: Command hangs or shows error

**Solutions**:
1. Check that port 8501 is available:
   ```bash
   lsof -i :8501  # On macOS/Linux
   ```
   Kill the process if port is in use
2. Verify poetry environment:
   ```bash
   poetry shell
   poetry install
   ```
3. Try running with debug logging:
   ```bash
   streamlit run coffee_maker/streamlit_app/app.py --logger.level=debug
   ```
4. Check for missing dependencies:
   ```bash
   poetry show | grep streamlit
   poetry show | grep plotly
   ```

---

### Issue: No data showing on any page

**Symptoms**: Empty states, "No data available" messages

**Solutions**:
1. Verify ACE is enabled:
   - Check Configuration page (when available)
   - Or check `coffee_maker/autonomous/ace/config.py`
2. Run the daemon to generate traces:
   ```bash
   poetry run code-developer --auto-approve
   ```
3. Check trace directory exists and has files:
   ```bash
   ls -la docs/generator/traces/
   ```
4. Verify API is working:
   ```bash
   python -c "from coffee_maker.autonomous.ace.api import ACEAPI; api = ACEAPI(); print(api.get_agent_status())"
   ```

---

### Issue: Charts not rendering

**Symptoms**: Blank spaces where charts should be

**Solutions**:
1. Clear browser cache (Cmd+Shift+R or Ctrl+Shift+R)
2. Try a different browser (Chrome recommended)
3. Check JavaScript console for errors (F12 ‚Üí Console tab)
4. Update Plotly:
   ```bash
   poetry update plotly
   ```
5. Restart the Streamlit server

---

### Issue: "Failed to load" error messages

**Symptoms**: Red error boxes on pages

**Solutions**:
1. Check the error message details (click to expand)
2. Verify data files exist:
   ```bash
   ls docs/generator/traces/
   ls docs/reflector/deltas/
   ls docs/curator/playbooks/
   ```
3. Check file permissions:
   ```bash
   chmod -R 755 docs/
   ```
4. Try restarting the app
5. If persistent, check logs:
   ```bash
   streamlit run coffee_maker/streamlit_app/app.py --logger.level=error
   ```

---

### Issue: App is slow

**Symptoms**: Pages take >10 seconds to load

**Solutions**:
1. Reduce time range in Analytics (use 7-30 days instead of 90)
2. Filter by specific agent instead of "All"
3. Clear old trace files:
   ```bash
   # Backup first!
   tar -czf traces_backup_$(date +%Y%m%d).tar.gz docs/generator/traces/
   # Delete traces older than 90 days
   find docs/generator/traces/ -name "*.json" -mtime +90 -delete
   ```
4. Check system resources (CPU, RAM):
   ```bash
   top  # or htop on Linux
   ```
5. Consider upgrading hardware or increasing available memory

## Tips & Best Practices

### Performance Tips

1. **Use Filters**: Always filter by agent or time range when dealing with large datasets
2. **Auto-Refresh Wisely**: Enable auto-refresh only when actively monitoring (it uses resources)
3. **Limit Bulk Actions**: Process <100 bullets at once to avoid timeouts
4. **Close Unused Tabs**: Only keep the current page open in your browser
5. **Periodic Cleanup**: Archive old traces regularly to keep the app fast

### Curation Best Practices

1. **Regular Reviews**: Daily quick checks + weekly deep reviews
2. **Effectiveness Threshold**:
   - Approve bullets with ‚â•0.7 effectiveness immediately
   - Monitor bullets with 0.3-0.7 effectiveness
   - Reject bullets with <0.3 effectiveness after review
3. **Category Balance**: Ensure playbooks have diverse categories (not all in one category)
4. **Bulk Actions**: Use bulk approve for similar high-quality bullets (saves time)
5. **Document Decisions**: Use metadata or external notes to track why bullets were rejected

### Monitoring Best Practices

1. **Set Up Alerts**: (Future feature) Configure email/Slack alerts for high error rates
2. **Daily Check-Ins**: Spend 2-3 minutes each morning reviewing traces
3. **Track Trends**: Use Analytics Dashboard to identify patterns over time
4. **Investigate Failures Immediately**: Don't let failures accumulate
5. **Baseline Metrics**: Establish normal success rates per agent (e.g., code_developer should be >90%)

### Analytics Best Practices

1. **Monthly Reviews**: Schedule regular performance reviews
2. **Compare Periods**: Look at 30-day trends vs. 90-day trends
3. **Focus on ROI**: Use Cost vs Effectiveness quadrant to optimize spending
4. **Implement Recommendations**: Act on at least the top 3 recommendations each month
5. **Share Insights**: Export charts and share with team/stakeholders

### Security Best Practices

1. **Access Control**: (Future feature) Limit who can approve/reject bullets
2. **Audit Trail**: (Future feature) Track who made changes
3. **Backup Data**: Regularly backup traces, playbooks, and configurations
4. **Review Sensitive Data**: Ensure traces don't contain secrets or PII
5. **Update Regularly**: Keep dependencies up to date for security patches
