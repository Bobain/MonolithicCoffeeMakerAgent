# Coffee Maker Agent - Prioritized Roadmap

**Last Updated**: 2025-10-09 🚨 **PRIORITIES REORGANIZED**
**Current Branch**: `feature/rateLimits-fallbacksModels-specializedModels`
**Status**: Refactoring phase completed ✅
**New Priority**: 🤖 **DAEMON FIRST** - Build autonomous daemon immediately, let it implement everything else!
**Vision**: Claude implements the roadmap autonomously while you plan!

---

## 🚨 Priority Reorganization (2025-10-09)

**What Changed**: Daemon moved from PRIORITY 3 → **PRIORITY 1**

**New Strategy**: Build minimal autonomous daemon FIRST, then let daemon implement remaining priorities autonomously!

**New Priority Order**:
1. 🤖 **Autonomous Development Daemon** (minimal MVP, 3-5 days) - **YOU ARE HERE**
2. 🎯 **Project Manager UI** (single interface for user, 1-2 days) - **HIGH PRIORITY**
   - View roadmap + daemon status in one place
   - See pending notifications (daemon questions)
   - Respond to daemon (approve dependencies, answer questions)
   - Simple terminal UI (TUI with `rich` library)
   - **User's single interface for everything**
3. 🗃️ **Database Synchronization** (daemon implements this with PM UI oversight!)
4. 📊 **Analytics & Observability** (daemon implements this!)
5. 📱 **Streamlit Dashboards** (daemon implements this!)
6. 🚀 **Advanced PM Features** (AI chat, Slack integration - daemon implements!)

**Rationale**: Get daemon working ASAP → Daemon autonomously implements everything else → Faster delivery!

**Reference**: `docs/PRIORITY_REORGANIZATION_2025_10_09.md` (detailed rationale and timeline)

## 🔧 Project Binaries (PyPI Package)

When published on PyPI, the `coffee-maker` package will provide **two command-line tools**:

### 1. `project-manager` - User Interface 👤

**Purpose**: Single interface for user to interact with roadmap and daemon

**Commands**:
```bash
# View roadmap and daemon status
project-manager status

# View pending notifications from daemon
project-manager notifications

# Respond to daemon questions
project-manager respond <msg_id> <answer>

# Manage roadmap
project-manager view
project-manager edit

# Control daemon
project-manager start-daemon
project-manager stop-daemon
project-manager pause-daemon
```

**Configuration** (`pyproject.toml`):
```toml
[project.scripts]
project-manager = "coffee_maker.cli.project_manager:main"
```

**User Experience**:
- Terminal UI with `rich` library
- Real-time daemon status display
- Interactive notification system
- Roadmap viewer/editor
- One command to rule them all!

---

### 2. `code-developer` - Autonomous Daemon 🤖

**Purpose**: Autonomous development daemon that implements roadmap (runs underlying Claude CLI)

**Commands**:
```bash
# Start daemon (runs continuously)
code-developer start

# Start in foreground (for debugging)
code-developer start --foreground

# Stop daemon
code-developer stop

# Check status
code-developer status

# View logs
code-developer logs --tail 100

# Pause daemon (finish current task, then wait)
code-developer pause

# Resume daemon
code-developer resume
```

**Configuration** (`pyproject.toml`):
```toml
[project.scripts]
code-developer = "coffee_maker.autonomous.daemon_cli:main"
```

**Daemon Behavior**:
- Runs as background process (daemon mode)
- Wraps Claude CLI (`claude code`) in subprocess
- Reads `docs/ROADMAP.md` continuously
- Implements priorities autonomously
- **ALWAYS asks permission** (core principle!)
- Creates demos after completion
- Notifies user via `project-manager`
- Never stops without user command

**Key Points**:
- User interacts ONLY with `project-manager`
- `code-developer` runs in background, wrapping Claude CLI
- `code-developer` calls `claude code` subprocess for each task
- All communication through file-based notifications
- User always has control (permission-first!)

### 📦 Installation & Setup

```bash
# Install from PyPI
pip install coffee-maker

# Verify binaries available
project-manager --version
claude-coder --version

# First-time setup
project-manager setup
# → Creates data/ directory
# → Initializes ROADMAP.md
# → Configures notification system

# Start daemon
project-manager start-daemon
# or directly:
claude-coder start

# Monitor status
project-manager status
```

---

### 🛡️ Safety Features (Built into MVP)

Both binaries enforce safety from day one:

**`claude-coder` Safety**:
- ✅ Permission-first architecture (ALWAYS asks)
- ✅ File lock on ROADMAP.md (no conflicts)
- ✅ Automatic rollback on test failures
- ✅ Timeout limits (won't run forever)
- ✅ Graceful shutdown (CTRL+C safe)

**`project-manager` Safety**:
- ✅ Input validation (no malformed responses)
- ✅ File lock enforcement (no concurrent edits)
- ✅ Audit log (all user responses logged)
- ✅ Emergency stop (can kill daemon immediately)

**Together**: Permission-first + Single interface = Safe autonomous development

## 🎯 Global Vision

### Phase 1: Self-Implementing System (Current)

Transform **Coffee Maker Agent** into a **self-implementing LLM orchestration framework** with:
- ✅ **Solid infrastructure** (refactoring completed)
- 🔄 **Ongoing cleanup** (codebase simplification in progress by parallel Claude instance)
- 🤖 **Autonomous development** (Claude implements the roadmap itself) ⚡ **NEW PARADIGM**
- 📊 **Advanced analytics** (Langfuse → SQLite/PostgreSQL export)
- 📚 **Professional documentation** (enhanced pdoc)
- 🤖 **Intelligent agents** (5 innovative projects)

**Revolutionary approach**: After implementing Priority 1 (Autonomous Daemon), you only plan features in the roadmap - Claude builds them autonomously!

**Current Status**: Building minimal autonomous daemon to prove the self-implementing concept.

---

### Phase 2: Universal Python Library 🌍 **FUTURE VISION**

**Transform into**: `roadmap-driven-dev` - A Python library that enables **ANY project** to be coded through roadmap-based conversations on top of user's existing code.

**Vision**: What we're building for ourselves becomes a product that helps thousands of developers build software through natural conversation instead of manual coding.

#### The Future Product

```python
# Any developer can use this in their project:
from roadmap_driven_dev import AutonomousDaemon

# Initialize in any Python project
daemon = AutonomousDaemon(
    roadmap_path="docs/ROADMAP.md",
    codebase_root=".",
    model="claude-sonnet-4",
    user_involvement="review_prs"  # or "approve_each_step", "full_autonomy"
)

# Daemon reads YOUR roadmap, understands YOUR codebase, implements YOUR features
daemon.run()

# Developer just:
# 1. Writes roadmap in natural language
# 2. Reviews PRs
# 3. Merges when satisfied
```

#### Key Features (Future)

1. **Language-Agnostic**: Works with any programming language (Python, TypeScript, Rust, Go, etc.)
2. **Codebase-Aware**: Understands existing patterns, follows project conventions
3. **Roadmap-Driven**: Natural language planning → Automatic implementation
4. **Human-in-the-Loop**: Configurable supervision levels (full autonomy ↔ approve each step)
5. **Git-Native**: Branches, commits, PRs follow Git best practices
6. **Test-Driven**: Automatically runs tests, rolls back on failure
7. **Cost-Optimized**: Uses cheaper models for simple tasks, advanced models for complex work
8. **Team-Ready**: Multiple developers + daemon collaborate via PRs

#### Example Use Cases

**Startup Building MVP**:
```markdown
# startup-roadmap.md
PRIORITY 1: User authentication with JWT
PRIORITY 2: PostgreSQL schema for users, products, orders
PRIORITY 3: REST API endpoints (CRUD for all entities)
PRIORITY 4: React frontend with authentication flow
```
→ Daemon implements all 4 priorities in 2 weeks while founders focus on customers

**Open Source Project**:
```markdown
# roadmap.md
PRIORITY 1: Add TypeScript support (currently JavaScript only)
PRIORITY 2: Migrate from Webpack to Vite
PRIORITY 3: Add comprehensive test coverage (currently 30%)
```
→ Daemon implements while maintainer reviews PRs

**Enterprise Migration**:
```markdown
# migration-roadmap.md
PRIORITY 1: Audit all Python 2 code (10,000+ files)
PRIORITY 2: Migrate to Python 3.11 (automated refactoring)
PRIORITY 3: Update all dependencies to latest versions
PRIORITY 4: Add type hints to all public APIs
```
→ Daemon handles tedious migration work

- Simple features take days instead of hours

**Our Solution**:
```
Natural Language Roadmap → Autonomous Implementation → Human Review → Merge
```

**Impact**:
- 🚀 Ship features 3-5x faster
- 💰 Reduce development costs by 50-70%
- 🧠 Developers focus on architecture, not typing
- 📈 Startups compete with bigger teams
- 🌍 More software gets built, faster

**This is the future of software development. We're building it now.** 🤖

---

### Phase 3+: Human-Like Development Team Interaction 👥 **ADVANCED VISION**

**Vision**: `code-developer` and `project-manager` interact with the user like a real, highly-focused development team would:

```
User (Product Owner)  ←→  project-manager (PM)  ←→  code-developer (Developer)
```

#### Three-Role Interaction Model

**User's Role** (Product Owner/End User):
- Defines features in natural language
- Reviews results and gives feedback
- Makes business decisions
- Tests features as end user

**`project-manager`'s Role** (Project Manager):
- Clarifies requirements with user
- Breaks down features into technical tasks
- Prioritizes work (critical bugs before new features)
- Reports progress and blockers
- Shields developer from constant interruptions
- Validates deliverables before showing to user

**`code-developer`'s Role** (Focused Developer):
- Implements features autonomously
- Asks PM technical questions (not the user directly)
- Reports completion to PM (not the user)
- Focuses on code quality and tests
- Works in deep focus without context switching

#### Example Conversation Flow

**1. Feature Request** (User → PM):
```
User: "I want users to be able to export their data to CSV"

project-manager: "Got it! Let me clarify a few things:
  - What data should be exported? (All fields or specific ones?)
  - Should this be a button in the UI or a CLI command?
  - Any size limits? (Some exports could be huge)
  - Format: headers, date format, encoding?"

User: "All user data, button in settings page, no size limit (pagination if needed), standard CSV with headers"

project-manager: "Perfect! I'll add this to the roadmap:

PRIORITY 5: CSV Data Export
- Add export button to settings page
- Include all user fields (name, email, created_at, etc.)
- Paginate for large datasets (>10k rows)
- Standard CSV: UTF-8, headers, ISO date format

I'll assign this to code-developer. ETA: 4-6 hours.
I'll notify you when it's ready for testing."
```

**2. Implementation** (PM → Developer):
```
project-manager → code-developer:
"New task from user: PRIORITY 5 - CSV Data Export
See ROADMAP.md for details.
User wants this in settings page with pagination.
Let me know if you have questions."

code-developer:
"Acknowledged. Starting implementation.
Question: Should CSV download trigger immediately or generate in background?"

project-manager:
"Good question. Let me check with user..."
→ [asks user, gets answer]
→ "User says immediate download is fine (<1s is acceptable)"

code-developer:
"Got it. Implementing now..."
→ [2 hours later]
→ "Feature complete. All tests passing.
   Created PR #123. Ready for PM review."
```

**3. Review & Delivery** (PM → User):
```
project-manager: "CSV export feature is complete! 🎉

Demo: demos/priority_5_csv_export/demo.py
PR: #123 (all tests passing ✅)

New Features:
  ✅ Export button in settings page
  ✅ All user data included
  ✅ Handles large datasets (tested with 50k rows)
  ✅ Standard CSV format

Please test and let me know if any changes needed."

User: "Looks great! But can we add a timestamp to the filename?"

project-manager → code-developer:
"User feedback: Add timestamp to CSV filename
Example: user_export_2025_10_09_14_30.csv"

code-developer:
"Done. Updated PR #123."

project-manager → User:
"Updated! Filename now includes timestamp. Ready to merge?"

User: "Perfect, merge it!"

project-manager: "Merged ✅. Feature is now live."
```

#### Advanced Interactions (Future)

**Developer Asking for Design Decisions**:
```
code-developer → project-manager:
"Implementing user authentication. Which approach:
  A) JWT tokens (stateless, scales well)
  B) Sessions (stateful, simpler, more secure)

Current codebase has no auth, so we can choose."

project-manager → User:
"code-developer needs decision on authentication:
  - JWT: Better for mobile apps, microservices
  - Sessions: Better for web-only, simpler

Which fits your use case better?"

User: "We're web-only, keep it simple"

project-manager → code-developer:
"User chose sessions (web-only, prioritize simplicity)"

code-developer: "Acknowledged. Implementing session-based auth."
```

**PM Shielding Developer from Noise**:
```
User: "Hey, can you add dark mode?"
User: "Also, the logo should be bigger"
User: "And can we have user profiles?"
User: "Oh, and email notifications would be nice"

project-manager:
"Got all your requests! Let me organize them:

CURRENT (In Progress):
  - PRIORITY 5: CSV Export (code-developer working on it)

BACKLOG (After current task):
  - PRIORITY 6: Dark mode
  - PRIORITY 7: User profiles
  - PRIORITY 8: Email notifications
  - PRIORITY 9: Bigger logo (quick win)

I'll batch these so code-developer can focus without context switching.
Sound good?"

User: "Yes, perfect!"

→ PM only interrupts developer for critical bugs, not every feature request
```

**PM Prioritizing Critical Bugs**:
```
User: "URGENT: Users can't login!"

project-manager → code-developer:
"🚨 CRITICAL BUG: Login broken
Pausing current work (PRIORITY 5).
Investigate immediately."

code-developer:
"Checking... Found issue: session timeout too short.
Fixed and deployed. Testing now."
→ [10 minutes later]
→ "Login working. Tests passing. Resumed PRIORITY 5."

project-manager → User:
"✅ Login fixed! Root cause: session timeout.
Increased to 24h. All users can login now.
code-developer back to CSV export feature."
```

#### Benefits of This Model

**For User**:
- Single point of contact (`project-manager`)
- Don't need to know technical details
- Can focus on business requirements
- Get progress updates without asking
- Feel like managing a real team

**For Project Manager**:
- Understand user's business needs
- Translate to technical requirements
- Prioritize work effectively
- Manage multiple tasks in backlog
- Shield developer from constant interruptions

**For Code Developer**:
- Deep focus without context switching
- Clear, technical requirements (not vague requests)
- Ask PM questions, not interrupt user
- Work autonomously on implementation
- Deliver to PM, not directly to user

#### Implementation Phases

**Phase 3A** (Month 3-4): PM-Developer Separation
- `project-manager` maintains ROADMAP.md
- `code-developer` reads ROADMAP.md, implements tasks
- PM reviews PRs before showing to user
- Communication via shared notification system

**Phase 3B** (Month 5-6): Natural Language Understanding
- PM understands vague requests ("make it faster", "improve UX")
- PM asks clarifying questions like a human PM
- Developer asks technical questions to PM
- PM translates between business and technical language

**Phase 3C** (Month 7-8): Context-Aware Collaboration
- PM knows when to interrupt developer (critical bugs)
- PM batches small requests to avoid context switching
- Developer proactively asks for design decisions
- PM tracks developer's focus time and productivity

**Phase 3D** (Month 9-12): Team Dynamics
- PM negotiates timelines ("User wants feature tomorrow" → "Realistically 3 days")
- Developer pushes back on unclear requirements
- PM advocates for technical debt paydown
- Team learns user's communication style and adapts

#### Success Criteria

- User feels like they have a **real development team**
- User never needs to think about "Claude CLI" or "technical implementation"
- PM handles all complexity, user just describes what they want
- Developer stays in deep focus 80%+ of the time
- Features get delivered 3-5x faster than human teams
- User trust increases (team is reliable, professional, predictable)

**This creates the illusion of a small, highly-efficient software team - but it's just two AI agents collaborating.** 👥🤖

**Current Status**: Phase 1 (Self-Implementing System) - Building the foundation by having the system implement itself first.

---

## 🔄 Recurring Best Practices

**Philosophy**: Every new feature implementation is an opportunity to improve the entire codebase. These practices should be applied **continuously** throughout development, not as separate tasks.

### 1. 🗃️ Database Synchronization Review ⚡ **CRITICAL**

**When**: Before implementing ANY feature that touches the database
**Why**: Daemon runs in isolated Docker environment - data must be accessible to both daemon and user

**Checklist**:
- [ ] Does this feature write to database? → Verify write goes to shared database path
- [ ] Does this feature read from database? → Verify read comes from shared database path
- [ ] Will daemon need this data? → Ensure it's in shared `/project/data/` directory
- [ ] Will user's tools need this data? → Ensure notifications/analytics are synced
- [ ] Are there concurrent writes? → Apply `@with_retry` decorator + WAL mode
- [ ] New database table? → Update Data Ownership Matrix in PRIORITY 1.5 design doc

**Common Pitfall**: Creating database in daemon's isolated `/daemon-env/data/` instead of shared `/project/data/`

**Reference**: `docs/PRIORITY_1.5_DATABASE_SYNC_DESIGN.md`

---

### 2. 🧹 Code Refactoring & Simplification

**When**: After implementing any feature, before marking it complete
**Why**: Technical debt accumulates quickly - clean as you build

**Sprint 1 Example** (Real work done):
- ✅ 800+ lines removed (deprecated code)
- ✅ 27 lines duplication eliminated (time threshold calculations)
- ✅ Manual retry loops → `@with_retry` decorator (11 methods)
- ✅ Missing observability → `@observe` decorator (11 methods)

**Refactoring Opportunities to Look For**:

**A. Manual Retry Loops → Centralized Utilities**
```python
# BEFORE (18 lines, repeated 3x):
attempt = 0
while attempt < 3:
    try:
        return self.invoke(**kwargs)
    except RateLimitError as e:
        print("Rate limit reached...")
        time.sleep(2**attempt)
        attempt += 1

# AFTER (cleaner, observable):
@with_retry(
    max_attempts=3,
    backoff_base=2.0,
    retriable_exceptions=(RateLimitError,),
)
def _invoke_with_retry():
    return self.invoke(**kwargs)
```

**B. Duplicate Calculations → Reusable Utilities**
```python
# BEFORE (9 lines, repeated 3x = 27 lines):
now = time.time()
if timeframe == "day":
    threshold = now - 86400
elif timeframe == "hour":
    threshold = now - 3600
# ... etc

# AFTER (1 line):
threshold = get_timestamp_threshold(timeframe)
```

**C. Missing Observability → Add `@observe` Decorator**
```python
# Add to all database queries, analytics methods, cost tracking
@observe
@with_retry(
    max_attempts=3,
    retriable_exceptions=(OperationalError, TimeoutError),
)
def get_llm_performance(self, days: int = 7) -> Dict:
    """Get LLM performance metrics."""
    # ... existing logic
```

**Checklist**:
- [ ] Search for repeated code patterns (copy-paste duplication)
- [ ] Identify manual retry/backoff logic → replace with `@with_retry`
- [ ] Find missing `@observe` decorators on critical methods
- [ ] Look for hard-coded magic numbers → extract to constants
- [ ] Check for orphaned/commented-out code → delete it
- [ ] Verify type hints on all public functions
- [ ] Run `ruff check` and `mypy` - fix all issues

**Reference**: `docs/sprint1_improvements_summary.md`

---

### 3. 📝 Documentation Updating

**When**: Immediately after changing any public API or adding features
**Why**: Stale documentation is worse than no documentation

**What to Update**:
- [ ] **Docstrings**: Update function/class docstrings with new parameters
- [ ] **ROADMAP.md**: Mark features complete, update status
- [ ] **README.md**: Add new CLI commands, update examples
- [ ] **Type hints**: Add/update return types and parameter types
- [ ] **Architecture docs**: Update diagrams if structure changed
- [ ] **Migration guides**: Document breaking changes

**Example**:
```python
# Update docstrings with type hints
def calculate_cost(
    self,
    timeframe: Literal["minute", "hour", "day", "all"] = "all",
    model: Optional[str] = None,
) -> Dict[str, float]:
    """Calculate LLM usage cost for a timeframe.

    Args:
        timeframe: Time window for cost calculation
        model: Optional model filter

    Returns:
        Dictionary with total_cost, input_cost, output_cost

    Example:
        >>> calc.calculate_cost(timeframe="day", model="gpt-4")
        {'total_cost': 5.23, 'input_cost': 2.10, 'output_cost': 3.13}
    """
```

**Tools**:
- Run `pdoc` to regenerate API docs: `python scripts/generate_docs.py`
- Check for TODO/FIXME comments: `grep -r "TODO\|FIXME" coffee_maker/`

---

### 4. 🧪 Test Coverage Maintenance

**When**: Before committing any changes
**Why**: Tests are living documentation and prevent regressions

**Checklist**:
- [ ] New feature → Add unit tests
- [ ] Bug fix → Add regression test
- [ ] Refactoring → Ensure existing tests still pass
- [ ] Database changes → Add integration tests
- [ ] API changes → Update API tests

**Test Philosophy**:
```python
# Test BEHAVIOR, not implementation
# GOOD:
def test_retry_exhaustion_returns_none():
    """When retries exhausted, should return None."""

# BAD:
def test_retry_calls_sleep_three_times():
    """Should call time.sleep() exactly 3 times."""
```

**Sprint 1 Results**: 112 tests passing (retry + time + analytics)

**Commands**:
```bash
# Run all tests
pytest tests/ -v

# Run with coverage
pytest tests/ --cov=coffee_maker --cov-report=html

# Run specific test file
pytest tests/unit/test_analytics.py -v
```

---

### 5. 🎨 Code Formatting & Linting

**When**: Before every commit (automated via pre-commit hooks)
**Why**: Consistent style improves readability and reduces diff noise

**Tools** (already configured):
- **black**: Code formatting
- **ruff**: Fast linting
- **mypy**: Type checking
- **isort**: Import sorting

**Commands**:
```bash
# Format all code
black coffee_maker/ tests/

# Lint and auto-fix
ruff check coffee_maker/ tests/ --fix

# Type check
mypy coffee_maker/

# Run all pre-commit hooks
pre-commit run --all-files
```

**Pre-commit Integration**: Hooks run automatically on `git commit`

---

### 6. 🔍 Performance Profiling

**When**: After implementing compute-intensive features
**Why**: LLM operations are expensive - optimize early

**What to Profile**:
- [ ] Database queries (use `EXPLAIN QUERY PLAN`)
- [ ] LLM token usage (via Langfuse analytics)
- [ ] Retry/timeout settings (too aggressive?)
- [ ] Connection pool size (too small/large?)

**Example**:
```python
# Profile database query performance
import time
start = time.time()
results = conn.execute("SELECT * FROM traces WHERE ...").fetchall()
print(f"Query took {time.time() - start:.2f}s")

# Use Langfuse to track LLM costs
@observe(capture_input=False, capture_output=False)
def expensive_llm_call():
    # Langfuse automatically tracks tokens, cost, latency
    pass
```

**Tools**:
- Langfuse dashboard for LLM metrics
- `cProfile` for Python profiling
- SQLite `EXPLAIN QUERY PLAN` for queries

---

### 7. 🔐 Security Review

**When**: Before releasing features that touch external APIs or user data
**Why**: LLM systems handle sensitive data - security first

**Checklist**:
- [ ] API keys stored in environment variables (not code)
- [ ] Database paths don't leak sensitive info
- [ ] User inputs sanitized before database queries
- [ ] Error messages don't expose internal details
- [ ] Logs don't contain API keys or secrets

**Example**:
```python
# GOOD:
api_key = os.environ.get("OPENAI_API_KEY")
logger.info("API request completed")

# BAD:
api_key = "sk-..."  # Hard-coded
logger.info(f"API request with key {api_key}")
```

---

### 8. 📊 Analytics & Observability

**When**: For all critical operations (LLM calls, database queries, external APIs)
**Why**: Can't optimize what you can't measure

**Add Observability**:
```python
# LLM operations
@observe
def call_llm(prompt: str) -> str:
    # Langfuse tracks: tokens, cost, latency, model
    pass

# Database operations
@observe
@with_retry(retriable_exceptions=(OperationalError,))
def get_traces(days: int) -> List[Dict]:
    # Track query performance and retries
    pass

# Critical business logic
@observe(capture_input=True, capture_output=True)
def process_roadmap_update(changes: Dict) -> bool:
    # Track input/output for debugging
    pass
```

**Sprint 1 Results**: 11 critical methods now observable in Langfuse

---

### 9. 🗂️ Dependency Management

**When**: Monthly review or when adding new dependencies
**Why**: Outdated dependencies have security vulnerabilities

**Commands**:
```bash
# Check for outdated packages
pip list --outdated

# Update specific package
pip install --upgrade langchain

# Update all packages (carefully!)
pip install --upgrade -r requirements.txt

# Security audit
pip-audit
```

**Best Practices**:
- Pin major versions: `langchain>=0.1.0,<0.2.0`
- Use `requirements-dev.txt` for dev dependencies
- Keep virtual environment clean

#### 🤖 DAEMON REQUIREMENT: New Dependency Approval ⚡ **CRITICAL**

**Rule**: The autonomous daemon **MUST ask for user permission** before adding any new dependency.

**Why This Is Critical**:

1. **Security** 🔐 - Dependencies can contain malicious code (supply chain attacks)
2. **License Compliance** ⚖️ - GPL in proprietary code = legal violation
3. **Cost Management** 💰 - Some dependencies have API usage costs
4. **Codebase Bloat** 📦 - `pandas` (200MB) when `csv` suffices
5. **Maintenance Burden** 🔧 - More dependencies = more updates, more breaking changes
6. **Version Conflicts** ⚠️ - New dependency may conflict with existing ones

**Implementation Pattern**:
```python
def request_dependency_approval(self, package: str, reason: str) -> bool:
    """Request user approval before installing dependency."""
    notification = f"""
🤖 DAEMON REQUEST: New Dependency Approval

Package: {package}
Reason: {reason}

Please review:
- Check package on PyPI (security, license, maintainers)
- Verify license compatibility
- Approve: /approve-dependency {package}
- Reject: /reject-dependency {package}
"""
    self.send_notification(notification)
    return self.wait_for_user_response(timeout=3600)  # 1 hour
```

**Example**:
```
🤖 DAEMON: May I install 'psycopg2-binary>=2.9.9'?
Reason: Required for PostgreSQL connection (PRIORITY 2)
License: LGPL-3.0
Size: ~5MB

👤 USER: /reject-dependency psycopg2-binary
Reason: We're using SQLite MVP, not PostgreSQL yet.

🤖 DAEMON: Acknowledged. Using sqlite3 (standard library).
```

**Pre-Approved Dependencies** (no permission needed):
- Standard library modules (no install)
- Already in `requirements.txt`
- Testing/linting (dev dependencies)

**This protects users from**:
- ✅ Malicious packages
- ✅ License violations
- ✅ Unexpected costs
- ✅ Bloat/conflicts
- ✅ Maintenance burden

**Non-negotiable for autonomous systems.** 🔐

---

### 10. 🎯 Roadmap Synchronization

**When**: After completing any feature or making architectural decisions
**Why**: ROADMAP.md is the source of truth for the autonomous daemon

**What to Update**:
- [ ] Mark completed priorities with ✅
- [ ] Update timelines based on actual effort
- [ ] Add new priorities discovered during implementation
- [ ] Update dependency chains (PRIORITY X → PRIORITY Y)
- [ ] Document architectural decisions (ADRs)
- [ ] Update estimates based on learnings

**Tool**: Use `coffee-roadmap` CLI (PRIORITY 2) for all roadmap updates

---

### 11. 🔄 GitHub CI/CD Monitoring (Daily Task)

**When**: Daily, after pushing to GitHub
**Why**: Catch CI failures early before they block development

**Daily Checklist**:
- [ ] Check if branch is pushed to remote (`git status`, `git branch -r`)
- [ ] Verify GitHub Actions are passing
- [ ] Review any failing tests or linting errors
- [ ] Fix issues immediately (don't let them accumulate)
- [ ] Ensure PR status checks are green before merging

**Commands**:
```bash
# Check remote branch status
git status
git branch -r | grep feature/your-branch

# Push if not synced
git push origin feature/your-branch

# Check GitHub Actions via CLI (requires gh CLI)
gh run list --branch feature/your-branch --limit 5

# View specific workflow run
gh run view <run-id>

# View logs for failed run
gh run view <run-id> --log-failed
```

**GitHub Actions to Monitor**:
- ✅ **Tests**: All pytest tests passing
- ✅ **Linting**: black, ruff, mypy checks
- ✅ **Type Checking**: mypy strict mode
- ✅ **Security**: pip-audit for vulnerabilities
- ✅ **Build**: Package builds successfully

**If CI Fails**:

1. **Read the error logs**:
   ```bash
   gh run view <run-id> --log-failed
   ```

2. **Reproduce locally**:
   ```bash
   # Run the same checks that GitHub Actions runs
   pytest tests/ -v
   black --check coffee_maker/ tests/
   ruff check coffee_maker/ tests/
   mypy coffee_maker/
   ```

3. **Fix the issue**:
   - Fix failing tests
   - Fix linting/formatting errors
   - Fix type errors
   - Update dependencies if needed

4. **Push the fix**:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "fix: Resolve CI failures - <brief description>"
   git push
   ```

5. **Verify fix**:
   ```bash
   gh run list --branch feature/your-branch --limit 1
   ```

**Automation Tips**:
```bash
# Add alias to check CI status
alias ci-status='gh run list --branch $(git branch --show-current) --limit 5'

# Check CI in watch mode (updates every 10s)
watch -n 10 'gh run list --branch $(git branch --show-current) --limit 1'
```

**🤖 DAEMON REQUIREMENT**:
The autonomous daemon **MUST** check CI status after every push and fix any failures before moving to next task. If CI fails:
1. Read error logs
2. Fix the issue
3. Push fix
4. Wait for CI to pass
5. Only then proceed to next task

**Example Workflow**:
```
Daemon pushes code → GitHub Actions run → CI fails (test failure)
↓
Daemon detects failure via `gh run list`
↓
Daemon reads logs via `gh run view --log-failed`
↓
Daemon fixes the test
↓
Daemon pushes fix
↓
Daemon waits for CI to pass (polls every 30s)
↓
CI passes ✅ → Daemon continues to next task
```

**Why This Matters**:
- **Prevents broken main**: Don't merge PRs with failing CI
- **Fast feedback**: Fix issues while context is fresh
- **Professional quality**: Passing CI is minimum bar
- **Team productivity**: Broken CI blocks everyone

---

### 12. 🔐 Security Vulnerability Monitoring (Daily Task)

**When**: Daily, first thing in the morning
**Why**: Security vulnerabilities can be exploited - fix immediately

**Priority**: 🚨 **TOP PRIORITY** - Security issues block all other work

**Daily Checklist**:
- [ ] Check GitHub Security tab for Dependabot alerts
- [ ] Review severity (Critical > High > Moderate > Low)
- [ ] For each vulnerability: Assess impact and create fix plan
- [ ] Fix vulnerabilities or document reason for delay
- [ ] Update dependencies with security patches

**Commands**:
```bash
# View security alerts via GitHub web UI
open https://github.com/Bobain/MonolithicCoffeeMakerAgent/security

# Check for vulnerable dependencies (local scan)
pip-audit

# Check specific package for vulnerabilities
pip-audit | grep <package-name>

# Update vulnerable package
pip install --upgrade <package-name>

# Check if update breaks anything
pytest tests/ -v
```

**Workflow for Security Alerts**:

1. **Identify Alert**:
   - Go to GitHub → Security → Dependabot alerts
   - Note severity, affected package, vulnerable version range
   - Read CVE details and impact assessment

2. **Assess Impact**:
   ```bash
   # Check where vulnerable package is used
   grep -r "import <package>" coffee_maker/ tests/

   # Check if we're affected by the vulnerability
   # (some CVEs only affect specific use cases)
   ```

3. **Determine Action**:
   - **Critical/High severity**: Fix immediately (drop everything)
   - **Moderate severity**: Fix within 24 hours
   - **Low severity**: Fix within 1 week

4. **Fix Options**:

   **Option A: Update Dependency** (Preferred)
   ```bash
   # Update to patched version
   pip install --upgrade <package>==<safe-version>

   # Update requirements.txt
   pip freeze | grep <package> >> requirements.txt

   # Test everything
   pytest tests/ -v
   black coffee_maker/ tests/
   mypy coffee_maker/
   ```

   **Option B: Wait for Third-Party Fix**
   If vulnerability is in a dependency we can't easily update:
   ```markdown
   # Create tracking issue
   Title: [SECURITY] Waiting for <package> security patch

   Description:
   - CVE: CVE-2024-XXXXX
   - Severity: High
   - Affected package: <package> <version>
   - Our mitigation: <describe workaround>
   - Tracking: <link to upstream issue>
   - ETA: <expected patch date>
   ```

   **Option C: Replace Dependency**
   If patch isn't available and risk is high:
   ```bash
   # Find alternative package
   pip search <alternative>

   # Ask user permission to replace dependency
   # (DAEMON MUST ASK PERMISSION - Section 9)
   ```

   **Option D: Mitigate Risk**
   If we can't update immediately:
   ```python
   # Add input validation
   # Disable vulnerable feature
   # Add rate limiting
   # Add monitoring/alerts
   ```

5. **Test Fix**:
   ```bash
   # Run full test suite
   pytest tests/ -v --cov=coffee_maker

   # Check for breaking changes
   python -m coffee_maker.cli.project_manager --version

   # Manual smoke test of critical features
   ```

6. **Document Fix**:
   ```bash
   git add requirements.txt
   git commit -m "security: Fix CVE-2024-XXXXX in <package>

   - Updated <package> from <old> to <new>
   - CVE severity: <High/Moderate/Low>
   - Impact: <describe what was vulnerable>
   - Tests: All passing

   Fixes: #<issue-number>"

   git push
   ```

7. **Verify on GitHub**:
   - GitHub Security tab should show alert as resolved
   - Dependabot should close the alert automatically
   - If not, manually dismiss with explanation

**🤖 DAEMON REQUIREMENT**:
The autonomous daemon **MUST** check security alerts daily and prioritize fixes:

1. **Every morning (00:00 UTC)**:
   - Check GitHub Security tab (via GitHub API)
   - Count alerts by severity
   - If Critical/High alerts exist: **PAUSE ALL OTHER WORK**

2. **Security-First Priority**:
   ```
   Critical/High vulnerability detected → STOP current task
   ↓
   Assess vulnerability impact
   ↓
   IF fix available: Apply update + test + commit + push
   IF no fix: Document mitigation + notify user
   ↓
   Verify alert resolved on GitHub
   ↓
   Resume previous task
   ```

3. **User Notification**:
   ```
   🚨 SECURITY ALERT: Critical vulnerability detected

   Package: requests==2.28.0
   CVE: CVE-2024-12345
   Severity: HIGH (8.5/10)

   Impact: Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)
   Fix available: requests==2.31.0

   Action: Updating dependency and running tests...
   [Progress bar]
   ✅ Fixed and verified. All tests passing.

   Commit: abc1234
   Branch: security/fix-requests-ssrf
   PR: #456
   ```

**Automation Script** (Future):
```python
# File: scripts/check_security_alerts.py
"""
Daily security alert checker.
Run: python scripts/check_security_alerts.py
"""

import requests
import os

GITHUB_TOKEN = os.environ.get("GITHUB_TOKEN")
REPO = "Bobain/MonolithicCoffeeMakerAgent"

def check_security_alerts():
    """Check GitHub Dependabot alerts."""
    url = f"https://api.github.com/repos/{REPO}/dependabot/alerts"
    headers = {"Authorization": f"token {GITHUB_TOKEN}"}

    response = requests.get(url, headers=headers)
    alerts = response.json()

    # Filter by severity
    critical = [a for a in alerts if a['security_advisory']['severity'] == 'critical']
    high = [a for a in alerts if a['security_advisory']['severity'] == 'high']

    if critical or high:
        print(f"🚨 {len(critical)} critical, {len(high)} high severity alerts!")
        return False
    else:
        print("✅ No critical/high security alerts")
        return True

if __name__ == "__main__":
    check_security_alerts()
```

**Example: Current Alerts (2025-10-09)**:
As of the last push, GitHub reported:
- 1 High severity vulnerability
- 4 Moderate severity vulnerabilities

**Next actions**:
1. Review: https://github.com/Bobain/MonolithicCoffeeMakerAgent/security/dependabot
2. Fix high severity issue immediately
3. Schedule moderate severity fixes within 24 hours

**Why This Matters**:
- **Prevents exploits**: Unpatched vulnerabilities = attack surface
- **Compliance**: Many organizations require <24h fix for high severity
- **Reputation**: Security issues damage trust
- **Legal risk**: Data breaches have legal consequences
- **Supply chain security**: Dependencies can be compromised

**Golden Rule**: When in doubt, fix security issues before features 🔐

### 13. 🔄 Daily Refactoring Opportunity Review

**When**: Daily, after completing any feature or update
**Why**: Small, incremental refactoring prevents technical debt accumulation

**Philosophy**: "Leave code cleaner than you found it" - Every change is an opportunity to improve

**Daily Questions to Ask**:

1. **Does this update create duplication?**
   ```python
   # BAD: Duplicated logic in two places
   def process_user_data(data):
       if data.get('name'):
           cleaned_name = data['name'].strip().lower()
           # ... 20 more lines ...

   def process_admin_data(data):
       if data.get('name'):
           cleaned_name = data['name'].strip().lower()  # DUPLICATE!
           # ... 20 more lines ...

   # GOOD: Extract common logic
   def clean_name(name: str) -> str:
       return name.strip().lower()

   def process_user_data(data):
       if data.get('name'):
           cleaned_name = clean_name(data['name'])
   ```

2. **Can this logic be simplified?**
   ```python
   # BAD: Overly complex
   def is_valid_user(user):
       if user is not None:
           if user.get('active'):
               if user.get('verified'):
                   return True
       return False

   # GOOD: Simplified
   def is_valid_user(user):
       return (user is not None
               and user.get('active', False)
               and user.get('verified', False))
   ```

3. **Are there new patterns that could be utilities?**
   ```python
   # If you find yourself writing similar code 3+ times:
   # → Extract to utility function or decorator

   # Example: Retry pattern repeated across multiple functions
   # → Already extracted to @with_retry decorator ✅
   ```

4. **Do function/variable names clearly communicate intent?**
   ```python
   # BAD: Unclear names
   def f(d):
       r = []
       for x in d:
           if x['s'] == 'active':
               r.append(x)
       return r

   # GOOD: Clear names
   def filter_active_users(users: List[Dict]) -> List[Dict]:
       active_users = []
       for user in users:
           if user['status'] == 'active':
               active_users.append(user)
       return active_users

   # EVEN BETTER: Using comprehension
   def filter_active_users(users: List[Dict]) -> List[Dict]:
       return [u for u in users if u['status'] == 'active']
   ```

5. **Could this be more type-safe?**
   ```python
   # BAD: Weak typing
   def process_data(data):
       return data.get('value', 0) * 2

   # GOOD: Strong typing
   from typing import Dict, Any

   def process_data(data: Dict[str, Any]) -> float:
       value = data.get('value', 0.0)
       return float(value) * 2.0
   ```

6. **Is there dead code or commented-out code?**
   ```python
   # BAD: Leaving commented code "just in case"
   def process_order(order):
       # Old implementation (keeping for reference)
       # result = old_way(order)
       # if result:
       #     return result

       # New implementation
       return new_way(order)

   # GOOD: Remove old code (it's in git history!)
   def process_order(order):
       return new_way(order)
   ```

**Daily Workflow**:

1. **Review Today's Changes**:
   ```bash
   # What did we change today?
   git diff HEAD~1 --stat

   # View actual changes
   git diff HEAD~1
   ```

2. **Identify Opportunities**:
   ```bash
   # Find potential duplication
   ruff check coffee_maker/ --select UP  # pyupgrade suggestions

   # Find code complexity issues
   ruff check coffee_maker/ --select C90  # McCabe complexity

   # Find overly long functions
   ruff check coffee_maker/ --select PLR0915  # too many statements
   ```

3. **Apply Boy Scout Rule**:
   > "Always leave the campground cleaner than you found it"

   If you touch a file:
   - Fix nearby code smells
   - Improve nearby variable names
   - Add missing type hints
   - Add missing docstrings
   - Remove unused imports

4. **Document Refactoring in Commit**:
   ```bash
   git commit -m "refactor: Simplify user validation logic

   - Extracted clean_name() utility (removes duplication)
   - Simplified is_valid_user() (reduced complexity)
   - Added type hints to process_data()
   - Removed commented-out dead code

   No functional changes, all tests passing."
   ```

**🤖 DAEMON REQUIREMENT**:
After implementing any feature, the daemon **MUST** review code for refactoring opportunities:

```
Implement feature → Tests pass → Daemon analyzes changes
↓
Questions:
- Is there duplication? (>2 similar blocks)
- Is there complexity? (functions >50 lines, nested >3 levels)
- Are there unclear names? (single letter variables, abbreviations)
- Is typing incomplete? (missing type hints)
↓
IF opportunities found:
  Create refactoring subtask
  Apply Boy Scout Rule
  Test again
  Commit refactoring separately
↓
Move to next task
```

**Example: Sprint 1 Refactoring Success** ✅

After implementing analytics features, we reviewed and found:
- **Duplication**: Retry logic repeated 5 times → Extracted `@with_retry` decorator
- **Complexity**: 800+ lines of deprecated code → Removed
- **Naming**: Unclear function names → Renamed for clarity
- **Result**: Cleaner codebase, easier maintenance

**Metrics to Track**:
```bash
# Code complexity (aim for <10 per function)
radon cc coffee_maker/ -s

# Maintainability index (aim for A/B grade)
radon mi coffee_maker/ -s

# Lines of code (should not grow unnecessarily)
cloc coffee_maker/
```

**When NOT to Refactor**:
- ❌ Right before a deadline
- ❌ When changing external API contracts (breaking changes)
- ❌ Large-scale refactoring without planning
- ❌ "Clever" optimizations without profiling

**When TO Refactor**:
- ✅ After adding a feature (clean up while context is fresh)
- ✅ When you notice duplication (3rd occurrence → extract)
- ✅ When tests are green (safe to refactor)
- ✅ Small, incremental improvements (not big rewrites)

**Tools**:
- `ruff check` - Find code quality issues
- `radon` - Measure complexity and maintainability
- `black` - Auto-format (eliminates style debates)
- `mypy` - Type checking (catch errors early)

**Golden Rules**:
1. 🔒 **Never refactor without tests** - Tests are safety net
2. 🔬 **One refactoring at a time** - Small, focused changes
3. 📝 **Separate refactoring commits** - Don't mix with features
4. ✅ **Tests must stay green** - No functional changes during refactor
5. 🎯 **Boy Scout Rule** - Always leave code cleaner

**This prevents technical debt accumulation** - 10 minutes daily saves hours later! ⏰

## Summary: Apply These Every Implementation Cycle

1. **Before starting**: Review database sync strategy (PRIORITY 1.5)
2. **During implementation**: Add `@observe` and `@with_retry` decorators
3. **During implementation**: Extract duplicated code to utilities
4. **After implementation**: Update documentation and type hints
5. **Before commit**: Run tests, linting, formatting
6. **After commit**: Update ROADMAP.md status
7. **After push**: Check GitHub Actions CI status and fix any failures ⚡ **NEW**
8. **After feature/update**: Review for refactoring opportunities (Section 13) 🔄 ⚡ **NEW**
9. **After PRIORITY completion**: Create demo + notify user ⚡ **NEW**
10. **Weekly**: Review for refactoring opportunities
11. **Monthly**: Dependency updates and security audit
12. **Daily (TOP PRIORITY)**: Check security vulnerabilities and fix immediately (Section 12) 🔐 ⚡ **NEW**
13. **Daily**: Monitor GitHub CI/CD status (Section 11) ⚡ **NEW**
14. **Daily**: Review if last update adds refactoring opportunities (Section 13) 🔄 ⚡ **NEW**

**🤖 For Autonomous Daemon** (Critical - Non-Negotiable):
- ⚠️ **NEVER STOP ASKING PERMISSION** - This is the CORE PRINCIPLE ⚡
- ⚠️ **ALWAYS ask permission before adding new dependencies**
- ⚠️ **ALWAYS ask permission before making architectural changes**
- ⚠️ **ALWAYS ask permission before breaking changes**
- ⚠️ **ALWAYS ask permission before external API calls**
- Explain why the action is needed
- Provide alternatives when possible
- Wait for user approval (1 hour timeout)
- Never proceed without explicit approval
- ⚠️ **ALWAYS create demo after completing a PRIORITY**

**🔴 CORE PRINCIPLE**: Permission-First Architecture
- This MUST be in MVP (version 0.1.0)
- This MUST be in every published version
- This is NON-NEGOTIABLE for ethical AI
- Daemon is powerful assistant, NOT autonomous overlord

**Goal**: Every feature leaves the codebase cleaner than before ✨

### 🎬 Demo & Notification After Priority Completion ⚡ **REQUIRED**

**When**: After completing ANY PRIORITY (before moving to next)

**Why**: User needs to understand what was built and how to use it

**What to Create**:

#### Option A: Interactive Demo (Preferred) 🌟
Create a runnable demonstration showing the new feature in action.

**Format**:
- Jupyter notebook (`.ipynb`) with code + explanations
- Python script with rich terminal output
- Video recording (screen capture with narration)
- GIF animations showing key interactions

**Example** (PRIORITY 2: Project Manager UI):
```bash
# File: demos/priority_2_project_manager_demo.py
"""
Interactive Demo: Project Manager UI

This demo shows how to use the new Project Manager UI to:
1. View roadmap and daemon status
2. Respond to daemon notifications
3. Approve/reject dependency requests

Run: python demos/priority_2_project_manager_demo.py
"""

from rich.console import Console
from rich.panel import Panel
from rich.table import Table

console = Console()

# Demo 1: View Roadmap
console.print(Panel("[bold cyan]Demo 1: Viewing Roadmap[/]"))
# ... runnable code ...

# Demo 2: Respond to Notification
console.print(Panel("[bold cyan]Demo 2: Responding to Daemon[/]"))
# ... runnable code ...
```

#### Option B: Documentation (Minimum) 📝
If interactive demo isn't feasible, create comprehensive documentation.

**Format**: Markdown file with:
- Overview of what was built
- Key features and capabilities
- Usage examples (code snippets)
- Screenshots/GIFs of UI
- Troubleshooting tips

**Template**:
```markdown

**Format**: Send notification through Project Manager UI

```python
# In daemon after completing priority
def notify_completion(priority_name: str, demo_path: str):
    """Notify user that priority is complete with demo link."""

    notification = {
        "type": "priority_completed",
        "priority": priority_name,
        "message": f"✅ {priority_name} is complete!",

## 🚀 Prioritized Roadmap

### 🔴 **PRIORITY 1: Analytics & Observability** ⚡ FOUNDATION FOR AUTONOMOUS DAEMON

**Estimated Duration**: 2-3 weeks
**Impact**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
**Status**: 🔄 **MOSTLY COMPLETE** (Core analytics done via Sprint 5, advanced features remaining)
**Why First**: Required for autonomous daemon to track its own work and errors

#### Project: Langfuse → SQLite Export & Analysis

**Core Features** ✅ **COMPLETED via Sprint 5**:
- ✅ Langfuse trace export to SQLite (exporter_sqlite.py)
- ✅ Performance analytics (analyzer_sqlite.py)
- ✅ Native sqlite3 implementation (zero dependencies)
- ✅ 5 database tables (traces, generations, spans, metrics, rate_limits)
- ✅ WAL mode enabled (multi-process safe)
- ✅ Export scripts (export_langfuse_data.py, analyze_performance.py)
- ✅ Configuration module (config.py)

**Remaining Features** 📝 **Planned**:
- [ ] Advanced metrics module (llm_metrics.py, prompt_metrics.py, agent_metrics.py)
- [ ] A/B testing for prompts (benchmark_prompts.py)
- [ ] Additional analytics queries (percentiles, trends, optimization insights)
- [ ] Dashboard integration (when PRIORITY 3+ implemented)

**Current Implementation**:
```

### 🔴 **PRIORITY 1.5: Database Synchronization Architecture** 🚨 **DESIGN-FIRST BLOCKER**

**Estimated Duration**: 2-3 days (design phase only)
**Impact**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (Critical infrastructure)
**Status**: 📝 Planned
**Type**: Design-only priority (no implementation, integrated into other priorities)
**Why Critical**: **BLOCKS PRIORITY 2 & 3** - Must resolve database sync before implementation

#### The Problem 🚨

We will have **two separate database instances**:

```
User's Project Environment          Daemon's Isolated Docker Environment
─────────────────────────           ─────────────────────────────────────
/project/data/                      /daemon-env/data/
  ├── langfuse_traces.db     ≠≠≠      ├── langfuse_traces.db
  ├── notifications.db       ≠≠≠      ├── notifications.db
  └── analytics.db           ≠≠≠      └── analytics.db

CONFLICT: Two separate databases with potentially overlapping/conflicting data!
```

**Specific Issues**:
1. **Notifications**: Daemon writes → Slack bot reads from user's DB (doesn't see it!)
2. **Analytics**: Daemon generates traces → User dashboard reads from user's DB (doesn't see them!)
3. **Roadmap State**: User updates roadmap → Daemon reads from daemon's DB (stale data!)

#### Architecture Options (4 Strategies)

**Option A: Shared SQLite via Docker Volume** ✅ **Recommended for MVP**
- Docker volume mounts user's data directory
- Single source of truth, real-time updates
- ⚠️ SQLite locking issues with concurrent writes
- Simple, good enough for single-developer local use

**Option B: Separate DBs + Unidirectional Sync**
- Daemon writes to isolated DB, periodically syncs to user DB
- Clean isolation, easy cleanup
- ❌ Sync complexity, data lag, storage duplication

**Option C: Network-Accessible PostgreSQL**
- Both connect to shared PostgreSQL instance
- True concurrent access, scales to teams
- ❌ Complex setup, heavier, overkill for local dev

**Option D: Hybrid (Split by Data Type)**
- Shared: analytics, notifications (Docker volume)
- Isolated: daemon internal state (isolated SQLite)
- Best of both worlds but more complex

#### Recommended Phased Approach

**Phase 1: MVP - Shared SQLite** (PRIORITY 1-3)
```yaml
# docker-compose.yml
services:
  daemon:
    volumes:
      - ./data:/project/data:rw  # Share data directory
    environment:
      - ANALYTICS_DB=/project/data/analytics.db
      - NOTIFICATIONS_DB=/project/data/notifications.db
```

**Database Guardrails for MVP**:
1. **WAL Mode**: Enable Write-Ahead Logging for SQLite (`PRAGMA journal_mode=WAL`)
2. **Timeout**: Set busy timeout to 5000ms (`PRAGMA busy_timeout=5000`)
3. **Retry Logic**: Wrap all writes with `@with_retry` decorator
4. **Connection Pooling**: Use SQLAlchemy connection pool (max 5 connections)
5. **Read-Heavy Pattern**: Daemon mostly reads, user mostly writes

**Phase 2: PostgreSQL Migration** (PRIORITY 4+ or later)
- Migrate when scaling to team collaboration or production
- Proper concurrent access with row-level security
- Migration script: SQLite → PostgreSQL

#### Deliverables (Design Phase)

- [x] **Problem Analysis Document** ✅ (`docs/PRIORITY_1.5_DATABASE_SYNC_DESIGN.md`)
- [ ] **Architecture Decision Record (ADR)** - Final choice with rationale
- [ ] **Data Ownership Matrix** - Strategy for each table
- [ ] **Concurrency Strategy** - How to handle concurrent writes
- [ ] **Implementation Guidelines** - Concrete code for PRIORITY 2 & 3
- [ ] **Testing Strategy** - How to test database access patterns
- [ ] **Migration Plan** - SQLite → PostgreSQL (if phased)

#### Timeline

**Day 1: Problem Analysis + Requirements** (4-6h)
- Document all use cases (local dev, team, production)
- List all database tables and sync requirements
- Create data ownership matrix (draft)

**Day 2: Architecture Evaluation** (6-8h)
- Prototype architectural options with code
- Test concurrent access scenarios
- Benchmark SQLite vs PostgreSQL performance
- Make recommendation

**Day 3: Decision + Documentation** (4-6h)
- Finalize architecture decision (with approval)
- Write ADR and implementation guidelines
- Document migration path (if phased)
- Review and sign-off

**Total**: 14-20h (2-3 days) - **Design only, implementation in other priorities**

#### Integration with Other Priorities

This is a **design-only priority**. Implementation happens in:
- **PRIORITY 1** (Analytics): Define DB schema with sync strategy
- **PRIORITY 2** (Roadmap CLI): Follow decided database access pattern
- **PRIORITY 3** (Daemon): Follow decided database access pattern
- **All notification priorities**: Use decided sync mechanism

**Reference**: `docs/PRIORITY_1.5_DATABASE_SYNC_DESIGN.md` (comprehensive 450+ line design document)

### 🔴 **PRIORITY 2: Roadmap Management CLI** ⚡ NEW 🎯 **FOUNDATION**

**Estimated Duration**: 2-3 days
**Impact**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (Critical foundation)
**Status**: 📝 Planned
**Dependency**: None (must be built BEFORE autonomous daemon)
**Why First**: Single source of truth for ROADMAP.md - simplifies daemon implementation

#### Project: AI-Powered Project Manager CLI (coffee-roadmap)

**Vision**: Create a dedicated **`coffee-roadmap` CLI tool** - an AI-powered project manager that provides an interactive chat interface for managing ROADMAP.md. This is the **ONLY way** to update the roadmap - both user and daemon use it.

---

#### 🎯 MVP Approach: Start Simple, Scale Smart

**Implementation Strategy**: Build in **two phases** to establish database guardrails first:

**Phase 1: MVP - Basic CLI with Database Guardrails** (2-3 days) ⚡ **START HERE**
- ✅ Shared SQLite via Docker volume (Option A from PRIORITY 1.5)
- ✅ Basic CLI commands (`view`, `status`, `notify`, `sync`)
- ✅ Notification database with proper retry logic
- ✅ WAL mode + timeout configuration
- ✅ `@with_retry` decorator on all writes
- ❌ NO Claude AI yet (too complex for MVP)
- ❌ NO rich terminal UI (basic text is fine)
- ❌ NO roadmap editing (read-only for MVP)

**Phase 2: Full AI Integration** (2-3 days) - After MVP validated
- Add Claude AI for natural language understanding
- Add rich terminal UI with `rich` library
- Add roadmap editing capabilities
- Add Slack integration
- Add history/undo functionality

**Why This Approach?**
1. ✅ **Database guardrails** established early (prevents future sync issues)
2. ✅ **Quick validation** (can test database patterns in 2-3 days)
3. ✅ **Risk mitigation** (complex AI features don't block daemon work)
4. ✅ **Foundation first** (proper patterns before fancy features)

**Reference**: `docs/PROJECT_MANAGER_MVP_DESIGN.md` (comprehensive MVP design with database patterns)

Overall Progress: ██████░░░░░░░░░░░░░░ 25% (2/8 priorities completed)

You: analyze the roadmap health

Claude: 🔍 Roadmap Health Analysis:

📊 Overall Health: 85/100 (Very Good)

Strengths:
✅ Clear priority order with logical dependencies
✅ Realistic time estimates (2-3 weeks per priority)
✅ Good balance of infrastructure vs features (40/60)
✅ All priorities have clear objectives

Concerns:
⚠️  PRIORITY 3 (Autonomous Daemon) is critical path - 60% complete
⚠️  5 priorities waiting on PRIORITY 3 completion
💡 Consider parallelizing PRIORITY 4 & 5 (both Streamlit dashboards)

Recommendations:
1. Focus resources on completing PRIORITY 3 (unblocks 5 priorities)
2. Plan PRIORITY 4 & 5 implementation in parallel (no dependencies)
3. Add time buffers for PRIORITY 8 (new, estimation uncertain)

You: What should we work on next?

Claude: 🎯 Recommendation: **PRIORITY 3 - Autonomous Development Daemon**

Reasoning:
1. **Critical Path**: Blocks 5 downstream priorities
2. **High Impact**: Enables self-implementing system (game-changer)
3. **Already 60% Complete**: Momentum is there, finish it!
4. **Foundation**: Required before daemon can implement PRIORITY 4-8

Next Steps:
1. Complete remaining 40% of PRIORITY 3 (estimated 1-2 days)
2. Run full integration tests
3. Document daemon usage
4. Mark PRIORITY 3 as ✅ COMPLETED
5. Let daemon autonomously implement PRIORITY 4 & 5 in parallel

Estimated completion: 2025-10-11 (2 days from now)

```

**Daemon Integration** (Programmatic API):

```python
from coffee_maker.cli.roadmap_editor import RoadmapEditor

# Daemon uses the same tool programmatically
editor = RoadmapEditor(roadmap_path="docs/ROADMAP.md")

# Update status when daemon completes a task
editor.update_status(
    priority="PRIORITY 3",
    status="🔄 In Progress",
    notes="Implemented overview page and cost charts"
)

# Daemon adds completion details
editor.mark_completed(
    priority="PRIORITY 3",
    completion_date="2025-10-15",
    deliverables=[
        "Multi-page Streamlit dashboard",
        "Interactive Plotly charts",
        "PDF/CSV export functionality"
    ],
    metrics={
        "lines_of_code": 847,
        "files_modified": 12,
        "tests_added": 23
    }
)
```

**Simplified Sync Mechanism** ⚡ **MUCH SIMPLER**:

Instead of complex file watchers and Git-based sync, we now have:

```python
class RoadmapSync:
    """Dead simple sync - just copy the file"""

    def __init__(self, roadmap_path: str, daemon_env_path: str):
        self.roadmap_path = roadmap_path
        self.daemon_env = daemon_env_path

    def sync_to_daemon(self):
        """Copy ROADMAP.md to daemon's isolated environment"""
        shutil.copy(self.roadmap_path, f"{self.daemon_env}/ROADMAP.md")
        logger.info("Synced roadmap to daemon environment")

    def sync_from_daemon(self):
        """Copy daemon's updates back to user roadmap"""
        shutil.copy(f"{self.daemon_env}/ROADMAP.md", self.roadmap_path)
        logger.info("Synced daemon updates to user roadmap")
```

**Benefits of This Approach**:
- ✅ **Single source of truth**: One tool controls all roadmap updates
- ✅ **Zero conflicts**: No concurrent writes (CLI serializes all updates)
- ✅ **Natural language editing**: Use Claude to modify complex roadmap
- ✅ **Daemon simplification**: No need for file watchers or Git sync
- ✅ **User-friendly**: Chat interface instead of manual YAML/Markdown editing
- ✅ **Validation**: CLI validates all changes before applying

### 🔴 **PRIORITY 3: Basic Autonomous Development Daemon** ⚡ NEW 🤖 **TOP PRIORITY**

**Estimated Duration**: 3-5 days
**Impact**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (Game-changing)
**Status**: 📝 Planned
**Dependency**: PRIORITY 2 (Roadmap Management CLI) - uses `coffee-roadmap` for updates
**Note**: Previously PRIORITY 2, renumbered after adding Roadmap CLI

#### Project: Minimal Self-Implementing AI System with Roadmap-Driven Development

**Vision**: Create a **simple, always-running** Python daemon that continuously reads ROADMAP.md and autonomously implements features via Claude CLI.

**Core Philosophy**: **Keep it minimal and focused** - just enough to autonomously implement features. Advanced features (monitoring, isolated environments) come later.

**Simplified Architecture** (thanks to PRIORITY 2):
- ✅ **No file watchers needed**: Daemon reads ROADMAP.md from its environment
- ✅ **No Git sync needed**: Uses `coffee-roadmap` API for status updates
- ✅ **No conflict resolution**: `coffee-roadmap` CLI handles all updates

**Two-Tier Architecture**:
1. **User → `coffee-roadmap` CLI**: User plans roadmap via interactive chat
2. **Daemon → `coffee-roadmap` API**: Daemon updates status programmatically

**Objectives**:
- Create a **minimal** Python daemon that supervises Claude Code CLI execution
- Enable Claude to read ROADMAP.md and autonomously implement features
- Automatic branch creation, implementation, PR creation, and progress tracking
- Simple Git-based safety with rollback capabilities
- **Daemon runs continuously** without stopping until all roadmap priorities are completed

**Key Features** (minimal set):
- 🤖 **Autonomous Implementation**: Claude reads roadmap and implements features
- 🔁 **Continuous Loop**: Daemon never stops, always looking for next task
- 🌳 **Basic Git Automation**: Auto-creates branches, commits, pushes, creates PRs
- 📊 **Simple Progress Tracking**: Updates ROADMAP.md with completion status
- 🔧 **CLI Integration**: Python subprocess wrapper for Claude CLI
- 🛡️ **Basic Safety**: Git-based versioning, all changes reversible
- 📝 **Self-Documentation**: Claude documents its own work in the roadmap

**Minimal Architecture** (keep it simple):
```
coffee_maker/autonomous/
├── __init__.py
├── daemon.py                      # Main daemon (single file, ~300-500 LOC)
├── roadmap_parser.py              # Parses ROADMAP.md for tasks
├── claude_cli_interface.py        # Subprocess wrapper for Claude CLI
├── git_manager.py                 # Basic Git operations (branch, commit, PR)
└── config.py                      # Simple configuration

scripts/
└── run_dev_daemon.py              # Daemon launcher (infinite loop)
```

**Deliverables** (minimal set):
- [ ] **RoadmapParser**: Extract tasks/priorities from ROADMAP.md (simple regex/markdown parsing)
- [ ] **ClaudeCLIInterface**: Basic subprocess wrapper for Claude CLI
- [ ] **GitManager**: Create branches, commit, push, create PRs via gh CLI
- [ ] **ProgressTracker**: Uses `coffee-roadmap` API to update status ⚡ SIMPLIFIED
- [ ] **DevDaemon**: Main loop that continuously reads roadmap and executes next task
- [ ] **Basic error handling**: Retry logic and simple logging
- [ ] **Setup documentation**: Quick start guide

**Example Workflow**:
```python
# User updates ROADMAP.md with new priority
# Then starts the daemon:

from coffee_maker.autonomous.daemon import DevDaemon

# Initialize autonomous development daemon
daemon = DevDaemon(
    roadmap_path="docs/ROADMAP.md",
    auto_approve=True,
    create_prs=True,
    model="claude-sonnet-4"
)

# Daemon reads ROADMAP.md and finds:
# "PRIORITY 2: Analytics & Observability - Status: 📝 Planned"

# Autonomous execution:
# 1. Creates branch: feature/analytics-export-langfuse
# 2. Prompts Claude: "Read docs/ROADMAP.md, implement PRIORITY 2"
# 3. Claude implements feature following roadmap guidelines
# 4. Claude commits with proper messages (following Git guidelines)
# 5. Runs tests automatically
# 6. Updates ROADMAP.md: Status: ✅ COMPLETED
# 7. Pushes branch and creates PR
# 8. Notifies user: "PRIORITY 2 completed, PR #123 ready for review"

# User reviews PR, merges if satisfied
# Daemon automatically moves to PRIORITY 3
```

**Interactive Messaging System** ⚡ NEW:

The daemon includes an intelligent message handler that intercepts Claude CLI's questions and can either:
1. **Auto-respond** based on predefined rules and roadmap context
2. **Notify user** for critical decisions requiring human judgment

```python
from coffee_maker.autonomous.claude_cli import MessageHandler

# Message handler configuration
handler = MessageHandler(
    auto_respond_rules={
        # Questions the daemon can answer automatically
        "continue?": lambda ctx: "yes" if ctx.tests_passed else "no",
        "commit now?": lambda ctx: "yes" if ctx.changes_valid else "no",
        "run tests?": lambda ctx: "yes",  # Always run tests
        "create PR?": lambda ctx: "yes" if ctx.branch_ready else "no",
    },
    notify_user_patterns=[
        # Questions that require user input
        r"API key",
        r"credentials",
        r"delete.*production",
        r"breaking change",
        r"merge to main",
    ],
    log_all_interactions=True,  # Log everything for traceability
    interaction_log_dir="coffee_maker/autonomous/interaction_logs/"
)

# Example interaction flow:
# 1. Claude asks: "Tests passed. Should I commit these changes?"
# 2. MessageHandler intercepts the question
# 3. Checks auto_respond_rules → matches "commit now?"
# 4. Evaluates lambda: ctx.changes_valid is True
# 5. Automatically responds: "yes"
# 6. Logs interaction to interaction_logs/2025-10-09_14-23-45.json

# For questions requiring user input:
# 1. Claude asks: "I found API key in .env. Should I commit it?"
# 2. MessageHandler detects pattern "API key" in notify_user_patterns
# 3. Logs the question
# 4. Pauses execution
# 5. Sends notification to user: "⚠️ Claude needs input: [question]"
# 6. Waits for user response
# 7. Forwards response to Claude
# 8. Logs the complete exchange
# 9. Resumes execution
```

**Interaction Logging**:

All Claude ↔ Python exchanges are logged with full context:

```json
{
  "timestamp": "2025-10-09T14:23:45Z",
  "priority": "PRIORITY 2: Analytics & Observability",

**Benefits of Interactive Messaging**:
- ✅ **Full traceability**: Every interaction logged with context
- ✅ **Intelligent automation**: Python answers routine questions automatically
- ✅ **Human-in-the-loop**: Critical decisions escalated to user
- ✅ **Debugging**: Complete audit trail of all Claude ↔ Python exchanges
- ✅ **Safety**: Prevents dangerous actions without explicit approval
- ✅ **Transparency**: User can review all interactions post-execution

**User Notification & Input Handling System** ⚡ NEW:

The daemon includes a **two-way (bidirectional) messaging system** that both alerts users and collects their input when needed. The underlying notification object is capable of both sending messages to users and receiving responses back, enabling true interactive communication between the autonomous daemon and the user.

**Notification Channels**:

1. **Terminal/CLI** (default, always enabled):
   ```
   ╔════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╗
   ║ 🤖 CLAUDE CLI - USER INPUT REQUIRED                       ║
   ╠════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╣
   ║ Priority: PRIORITY 2 - Analytics & Observability           ║
   ║ Phase: Implementation                                      ║
   ║ Time: 2025-10-09 14:23:45                                 ║
   ╠════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╣
   ║ Question from Claude:                                      ║

   ║                                                            ║
   ║ Options: [yes/no/skip]                                    ║
   ║ Timeout: 5 minutes                                        ║
   ╚════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╝
   Your answer: _
   ```

2. **Desktop Notifications** (macOS, Linux, Windows):
   - Uses native notification APIs
   - Click notification to open input prompt
   - Configurable sound/priority

3. **Webhooks** (Slack, Discord, Teams, etc.):
   - POST notification to configured webhook URL
   - Supports interactive buttons (Slack/Discord)
   - Reply via webhook or terminal

4. **Email** (optional, for long-running tasks):
   - Send email with question
   - Reply to email or via web link
   - Useful for overnight/weekend executions

**Configuration Example**:

```python
from coffee_maker.autonomous.notifications import Notifier, InputHandler

# Configure notification channels
notifier = Notifier(
    channels={
        "terminal": {"enabled": True, "priority": "high"},
        "desktop": {
            "enabled": True,
            "platforms": ["macos", "linux"],  # Auto-detect platform
            "sound": True,
            "urgency": "critical"
        },
        "webhook": {
            "enabled": True,
            "url": "https://hooks.slack.com/services/YOUR/WEBHOOK/URL",
            "type": "slack",  # or "discord", "teams", "generic"
            "mention_user": "@developer"  # Slack/Discord mention
        },
        "email": {
            "enabled": False,  # Optional
            "smtp_server": "smtp.gmail.com",
            "to": "developer@example.com",
            "from": "claude-daemon@example.com"
        }
    },
    fallback_order=["terminal", "desktop", "webhook", "email"]
)

# Configure input handler
input_handler = InputHandler(
    timeout=300,  # 5 minutes default
    validation_rules={
        "yes/no": lambda x: x.lower() in ["yes", "no", "y", "n"],
        "continue": lambda x: x.lower() in ["continue", "stop", "skip"],
    },
    retry_on_invalid=True,
    max_retries=3
)
```

**End-to-End Flow with Notifications**:

```python
# 1. Claude encounters a question requiring user input
claude_question = "I found API key in .env. Should I commit it?"

# 2. MessageHandler detects it needs user input
if message_handler.requires_user_input(claude_question):

    # 3. Create notification
    notification = {
        "title": "🤖 Claude CLI - Input Required",
        "priority": "PRIORITY 2: Analytics & Observability",
        "phase": "implementation",
        "question": claude_question,
        "options": ["yes", "no", "skip"],
        "timeout": 300,  # 5 minutes
        "context": {
            "file": ".env",
            "branch": "feature/analytics-export-langfuse",
            "severity": "critical"
        }
    }

    # 4. Send notifications via all enabled channels
    notifier.send(notification)
    # → Terminal: Rich formatted prompt
    # → Desktop: Native notification
    # → Slack: Interactive message with buttons

    # 5. Wait for user input (blocking or async)
    user_response = input_handler.wait_for_input(
        notification_id=notification["id"],
        timeout=300,
        validation="yes/no"
    )

    # 6. Handle response
    if user_response.timed_out:
        # Use default safe action
        response = "no"  # Don't commit sensitive data by default
        notifier.send_timeout_alert(notification)
    elif user_response.valid:
        response = user_response.value
    else:
        response = "skip"  # Invalid input

    # 7. Log the interaction
    interaction_logger.log({
        "question": claude_question,
        "notification_sent_to": ["terminal", "desktop", "slack"],
        "user_response": response,
        "response_time_seconds": user_response.elapsed_time,
        "timed_out": user_response.timed_out
    })

    # 8. Forward response to Claude
    message_handler.respond_to_claude(response)
```

**Notification Queue Management**:

For multiple concurrent questions:

```python
# Queue manages multiple pending notifications
queue = NotificationQueue()

# Add notifications
queue.add(notification1, priority="high")
queue.add(notification2, priority="medium")
queue.add(notification3, priority="low")

# Process in priority order
while not queue.empty():
    notification = queue.get_next()
    user_response = input_handler.wait_for_input(notification)
    queue.mark_complete(notification.id, user_response)
```

**Unified Slack Integration** ⚡ NEW - Dual Interface:

Slack notifications can interact with **BOTH** the daemon and the project manager CLI:

```python
# Slack receives interactive message with dual routing:
{
  "text": "🤖 *Coffee Maker - Input Required*",
  "blocks": [
    {
      "type": "section",
      "text": {
        "type": "mrkdwn",
        "text": "*From:* Autonomous Daemon\n*Priority:* PRIORITY 2 - Analytics & Observability\n*Phase:* Implementation"
      }
    },
    {
      "type": "section",
      "text": {
        "type": "mrkdwn",
        "text": "*Question from Claude:*\nI found an API key in .env file. Should I commit it?"
      }
    },
    {
      "type": "actions",
      "elements": [
        {"type": "button", "text": {"type": "plain_text", "text": "✅ Yes"}, "value": "daemon:yes"},
        {"type": "button", "text": {"type": "plain_text", "text": "❌ No"}, "value": "daemon:no"},
        {"type": "button", "text": {"type": "plain_text", "text": "⏭️ Skip"}, "value": "daemon:skip"}
      ]
    },
    {
      "type": "divider"
    },
    {
      "type": "section",
      "text": {
        "type": "mrkdwn",
        "text": "💬 *Or interact with Project Manager:*"
      }
    },
    {
      "type": "actions",
      "elements": [
        {"type": "button", "text": {"type": "plain_text", "text": "📝 Update Roadmap"}, "value": "pm:/update"},
        {"type": "button", "text": {"type": "plain_text", "text": "📊 View Status"}, "value": "pm:/view"},
        {"type": "button", "text": {"type": "plain_text", "text": "📈 Show Metrics"}, "value": "pm:/metrics"}
      ]
    }
  ]
}

# User interaction routing:
# 1. Click "No" button → Routes to daemon: daemon.respond("no")
# 2. Click "Update Roadmap" → Routes to PM: coffee_roadmap.execute("/update PRIORITY 2 status in-progress")
# 3. Type message in thread → Routes to PM chat: coffee_roadmap.chat("Add priority for...")
```

**Dual-Routing Architecture**:

```python
from coffee_maker.notifications import UnifiedNotificationHub

# Unified notification hub routes messages to daemon OR project manager
hub = UnifiedNotificationHub(
    daemon=daemon,
    project_manager=coffee_roadmap_cli,
    notification_db="data/notifications.db"  # Store all notifications
)

# Slack webhook receives user action
@app.route("/slack/actions", methods=["POST"])
def slack_actions():
    payload = request.json
    action_value = payload["actions"][0]["value"]

    # Route based on prefix
    if action_value.startswith("daemon:"):
        # Route to daemon
        response = action_value.split(":", 1)[1]  # "yes", "no", "skip"
        hub.route_to_daemon(response)

    elif action_value.startswith("pm:"):
        # Route to project manager CLI
        command = action_value.split(":", 1)[1]  # "/update", "/view", etc.
        result = hub.route_to_project_manager(command)

        # Post result back to Slack
        return jsonify({
            "text": f"✅ Project Manager: {result}"
        })

# User can also chat directly in Slack thread
@app.route("/slack/events", methods=["POST"])
def slack_events():
    event = request.json["event"]

    if event["type"] == "message":
        user_message = event["text"]

        # Determine routing (daemon vs PM)
        if "roadmap" in user_message.lower() or any(cmd in user_message for cmd in ["/add", "/update", "/view"]):
            # Route to project manager
            response = hub.route_to_project_manager(user_message)
        else:
            # Route to daemon
            response = hub.route_to_daemon(user_message)

        # Post AI response to Slack
        post_to_slack(event["channel"], response)
```

**Notification Database Schema** ⚡ NEW:

```sql
-- Store all notifications for both daemon and PM

```

**Langfuse Integration Example**:

```python
from langfuse import Langfuse
from coffee_maker.autonomous.notifications import Notifier

# All daemon operations traced in Langfuse
langfuse = Langfuse()

# Main trace for autonomous implementation session
trace = langfuse.trace(
    name="autonomous-implementation",
    metadata={
        "priority": "PRIORITY 2: Analytics & Observability",
        "branch": "feature/analytics-export-langfuse"
    }
)

# Span for user notification
notification_span = trace.span(
    name="user-notification-required",
    input={
        "question": "Found API key in .env. Commit it?",
        "channels": ["terminal", "desktop", "slack"],
        "timeout": 300
    }
)

# Log user response
notification_span.end(
    output={
        "user_response": "no",
        "response_time_seconds": 45.2,
        "channel_used": "slack",
        "timed_out": False
    }
)
```

**Structured Logging**:

```python
import structlog

logger = structlog.get_logger()

# Log notification sent
logger.info(
    "notification_sent",
    notification_id="notif-001",
    question_type="security_check",
    channels=["terminal", "desktop", "slack"],
    severity="critical"
)

# Log user response
logger.info(
    "user_response_received",
    notification_id="notif-001",
    response="no",
    response_time_ms=45200,
    channel="slack",
    valid=True
)
```

**Metrics Tracked**:
- Notifications sent per hour/day
- Average user response time per channel
- Timeout rate by question type
- Most common questions requiring user input
- Channel effectiveness (response rate)
- Daemon blocking time waiting for user

**Benefits of Observability**:
- ✅ **Full traceability**: Every notification in Langfuse
- ✅ **Performance insights**: Identify slow response patterns
- ✅ **Trend analysis**: Track autonomous vs manual decisions
- ✅ **Debugging**: Correlate notifications with Claude actions
- ✅ **Cost tracking**: Monitor LLM usage during autonomous execution

**Safety Guarantees**:
- ✅ **All changes in Git**: Complete version history, easy rollback
- ✅ **Follows roadmap guidelines**: Git conventions, commit messages, tests
- ✅ **PR-based workflow**: Human review before merging to main
- ✅ **Test validation**: Auto-runs tests, blocks commits on failures
- ✅ **Branch isolation**: Each priority in separate branch
- ✅ **Progress transparency**: All changes documented in ROADMAP.md

**Benefits**:
- 🚀 **Accelerated development**: Claude implements while you plan
- 🤖 **Self-improving system**: Framework builds itself
- 📊 **Full traceability**: Every change documented and versioned
- 🎯 **Roadmap-driven**: Ensures alignment with project vision
- 💰 **Cost-effective**: Automation of repetitive implementation tasks
- 🧪 **Quality assured**: Tests run automatically before commits
- 🔄 **Continuous delivery**: Features implemented as soon as planned

**Real-Time ROADMAP.md Update Mechanism** ⚡ NEW:

The daemon needs to **safely update** the user's ROADMAP.md while avoiding conflicts. Here's the robust architecture:

**Challenge**: Both user and daemon modify ROADMAP.md simultaneously
- User adds new priorities, updates requirements
- Daemon updates task statuses, adds completion notes

**Solution: File Watcher + Git-Based Conflict Resolution**

```python
from coffee_maker.autonomous.roadmap import RoadmapSync

# Real-time bidirectional sync
sync = RoadmapSync(
    roadmap_path="docs/ROADMAP.md",
    sync_strategy="git-based",  # or "file-lock", "event-driven"
    conflict_resolution="user-wins",  # User changes always take precedence
    update_interval=5,  # Check for changes every 5 seconds
)

# Daemon workflow:
# 1. Daemon reads ROADMAP.md
# 2. Daemon implements feature
# 3. Before updating ROADMAP.md, daemon checks for user changes
# 4. If user modified ROADMAP.md → merge changes intelligently
# 5. Daemon updates only its designated sections (Status, Progress)
# 6. User modifications preserved (Requirements, Objectives)
```

**Architecture Options**:

### **Option 1: Git-Based Sync** ✅ **RECOMMENDED**

Use Git as the single source of truth:

```python
class GitBasedRoadmapSync:
    """Git-based real-time ROADMAP.md synchronization"""

    def __init__(self, roadmap_path: str):
        self.roadmap_path = roadmap_path
        self.daemon_branch = "daemon/roadmap-updates"
        self.user_branch = "main"

    def update_roadmap(self, updates: Dict[str, str]):
        """Safely update ROADMAP.md with daemon progress"""

        # 1. Fetch latest changes from user
        subprocess.run(["git", "fetch", "origin", self.user_branch])

        # 2. Check if user modified ROADMAP.md since last read
        result = subprocess.run(
            ["git", "diff", "HEAD", f"origin/{self.user_branch}", "--", self.roadmap_path],
            capture_output=True
        )

        if result.stdout:  # User made changes
            # 3. Pull user changes first
            subprocess.run(["git", "pull", "origin", self.user_branch])

            # 4. Re-read roadmap with user updates
            roadmap = self._read_roadmap()

        # 5. Apply daemon updates to specific sections only
        updated_roadmap = self._apply_daemon_updates(roadmap, updates)

        # 6. Write updated roadmap
        self._write_roadmap(updated_roadmap)

        # 7. Commit daemon changes
        subprocess.run(["git", "add", self.roadmap_path])
        subprocess.run([
            "git", "commit", "-m",
            f"chore(roadmap): update progress - {updates['priority']}"
        ])

        # 8. Push to remote
        subprocess.run(["git", "push", "origin", self.daemon_branch])

        # 9. Create PR for user review (optional, auto-merge if safe)
        if self._is_safe_to_merge():
            subprocess.run(["git", "merge", self.daemon_branch])
        else:
            self._create_pr_for_review()
```

**Benefits**:
- ✅ Git tracks all changes (full audit trail)
- ✅ User can review daemon updates via PRs
- ✅ Easy rollback if daemon makes mistakes
- ✅ Works with existing Git workflow

### **Option 2: File Lock with Retry** (Simpler, less robust)

```python
import fcntl
import time

class FileLockRoadmapSync:
    """File lock-based synchronization (simpler but less robust)"""

    def update_roadmap(self, updates: Dict[str, str]):
        """Update ROADMAP.md with file locking"""

        max_retries = 5
        for attempt in range(max_retries):
            try:
                # 1. Acquire exclusive lock
                with open(self.roadmap_path, "r+") as f:
                    fcntl.flock(f.fileno(), fcntl.LOCK_EX | fcntl.LOCK_NB)

                    # 2. Read current roadmap
                    content = f.read()

                    # 3. Apply updates
                    updated_content = self._apply_updates(content, updates)

            except BlockingIOError:
                # User is currently editing the file
                logger.warning(f"Roadmap locked, retry {attempt + 1}/{max_retries}")
                time.sleep(2 ** attempt)  # Exponential backoff

        logger.error("Failed to acquire roadmap lock after retries")
```

**Benefits**:
- ✅ Simple implementation
- ✅ Prevents concurrent writes
- ❌ No version history
- ❌ Can't detect user changes after daemon reads

### **Option 3: Event-Driven with File Watcher** ⚡ **BEST FOR REAL-TIME**

```python
from watchdog.observers import Observer
from watchdog.events import FileSystemEventHandler

class RoadmapWatcher(FileSystemEventHandler):
    """Watch for user changes to ROADMAP.md in real-time"""

    def __init__(self, daemon):
        self.daemon = daemon
        self.last_modified_by = None

    def on_modified(self, event):
        if event.src_path.endswith("ROADMAP.md"):
            # 1. Check who modified (user or daemon)
            if self.last_modified_by == "daemon":
                # Daemon just updated, ignore
                self.last_modified_by = None
                return

            # 2. User modified the roadmap
            logger.info("User modified ROADMAP.md, reloading tasks")

            # 3. Re-parse roadmap for new tasks
            new_tasks = self.daemon.roadmap_parser.parse()

            # 4. Update daemon's task queue
            self.daemon.task_queue.update(new_tasks)

            # 5. Notify daemon of changes
            self.daemon.on_roadmap_updated(new_tasks)

# Usage:
observer = Observer()
observer.schedule(RoadmapWatcher(daemon), path="docs/", recursive=False)
observer.start()

# Daemon updates roadmap:
def update_roadmap_status(priority: str, status: str):
    watcher.last_modified_by = "daemon"  # Mark as daemon update

    # Apply update
    roadmap = read_roadmap()
    roadmap = update_status(roadmap, priority, status)
    write_roadmap(roadmap)

    # Watcher will ignore this change (last_modified_by = "daemon")
```

**Benefits**:
- ✅ **True real-time** updates (< 1 second latency)
- ✅ Daemon instantly aware of user changes
- ✅ User sees daemon progress updates immediately
- ✅ Works with any editor (VS Code, vim, etc.)

### **Option 4: Section-Based Locking** (Most Precise)

```python
class SectionBasedRoadmapSync:
    """Update only specific sections, avoid conflicts"""

    DAEMON_SECTIONS = [
        "## 📋 Project Status",
        "### 🔄 In Progress",
        "### ✅ Completed Projects"
    ]

    USER_SECTIONS = [
        "## 🚀 Prioritized Roadmap",
        "**Objectives**:",
        "**Key Features**:"
    ]

    def update_roadmap(self, section: str, updates: str):
        """Update only daemon-owned sections"""

        if section not in self.DAEMON_SECTIONS:
            raise ValueError(f"Daemon cannot modify {section}")

        # 1. Read roadmap
        roadmap = self._read_roadmap()

        # 2. Parse into sections
        sections = self._parse_sections(roadmap)

        # 3. Update only daemon section
        sections[section] = updates

        # 4. Preserve user sections unchanged
        for user_section in self.USER_SECTIONS:
            # Don't touch user sections
            pass

        # 5. Reconstruct roadmap
        updated_roadmap = self._reconstruct_roadmap(sections)

        # 6. Write back
        self._write_roadmap(updated_roadmap)
```

**Example Section Ownership**:

```markdown
## 📋 Project Status  ← DAEMON OWNS (can update status)

### ✅ Completed Projects
**Status**: ✅ COMPLETED  ← Daemon updates this
**Completion Date**: 2025-10-10  ← Daemon updates this

## 🚀 Prioritized Roadmap  ← USER OWNS (daemon read-only)

### 🔴 PRIORITY 2: Analytics
**Objectives**:  ← User defines this
- Export Langfuse traces  ← User defines this
**Status**: 🔄 In Progress  ← Daemon updates this
```

**Benefits**:
- ✅ Clear ownership boundaries
- ✅ Zero conflicts (daemon/user edit different sections)
- ✅ User can update requirements while daemon works
- ✅ Daemon can update status while user plans

### **Recommended Implementation: Hybrid Approach** ⚡

Combine the best of all approaches:

```python
class HybridRoadmapSync:
    """Best of all worlds: Git + File Watcher + Section Locking"""

    def __init__(self):
        self.git_sync = GitBasedRoadmapSync()
        self.file_watcher = RoadmapWatcher(self)
        self.section_lock = SectionBasedRoadmapSync()

    def start(self):
        # 1. Start file watcher for real-time user changes
        self.file_watcher.start()

        # 2. Use Git for daemon updates (audit trail)
        # 3. Use section locking to prevent conflicts

    def update_progress(self, priority: str, status: str, notes: str):
        """Daemon updates progress safely"""

        # 1. Check for user changes (via file watcher)
        if self.file_watcher.user_modified:
            # 2. Pull latest user changes from Git
            self.git_sync.pull_user_changes()

        # 3. Update only daemon-owned section
        updates = {
            "section": "### 🔄 In Progress",
            "priority": priority,
            "status": status,
            "notes": notes,
            "timestamp": datetime.now().isoformat()
        }

        # 4. Apply section-locked update
        self.section_lock.update_roadmap(updates["section"], updates)

        # 5. Commit to Git for audit trail
        self.git_sync.commit_daemon_update(updates)

        # 6. Mark as daemon update (file watcher ignores)
        self.file_watcher.last_modified_by = "daemon"
```

**Complete Flow Example**:

```
User Action                          Daemon Action
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
User opens ROADMAP.md
User adds new PRIORITY 8
User saves file                      → File watcher detects change
                                     → Daemon reloads roadmap
                                     → Daemon adds PRIORITY 8 to queue
                                     → Daemon starts PRIORITY 8

User continues editing               → Daemon implements feature
User updates PRIORITY 9 objectives   → Daemon runs tests
User saves file                      → File watcher detects change
                                     → Daemon reloads (sees PRIORITY 9 update)

                                     → Daemon completes PRIORITY 8
                                     → Daemon updates "In Progress" section
                                     → File watcher marks as daemon update
User sees status change ← ────────── → Daemon saves ROADMAP.md
User reviews daemon update           → Daemon commits to Git
User merges daemon PR                → Daemon moves to PRIORITY 9
```

**Claude CLI Agent Integration with Two-Way Messaging System** ⚡ NEW:

The Claude CLI agent leverages the two-way messaging system (described above) to interact with the project manager when it needs input or wants to report important milestones.

**Use Cases**:

1. **Questions Requiring Project Manager Input**:
   - "I found an API key in .env. Should I commit it?" (security decision)
   - "Test XYZ is failing. Should I fix it or skip it?" (scope decision)
   - "I found duplicate code. Should I refactor now or defer?" (priority decision)
   - "Should I use library X or Y for this feature?" (architecture decision)
   - "The current branch is behind main by 5 commits. Should I rebase?" (git workflow decision)

2. **Important Milestone Notifications**:
   - "✅ PRIORITY 2 implementation complete - 112/112 tests passing"
   - "📝 Pull request #123 created and ready for review"
   - "⚠️ Rate limit reached on OpenAI API - waiting 60 seconds"
   - "🎉 All deliverables for Sprint 1 completed"
   - "🔄 Started working on PRIORITY 3 - Streamlit Dashboard"
   - "❌ Build failed - 3 type errors found in module X"

        "tests_passed": 45,
        "files_changed": 8,
        "lines_added": 320
    }
)
```

**Benefits**:
- ✅ **Autonomous with oversight**: Claude works independently but asks when uncertain
- ✅ **Milestone visibility**: Project manager always knows current progress
- ✅ **Smart escalation**: Only critical questions interrupt project manager
- ✅ **Multi-channel**: Notifications reach project manager wherever they are
- ✅ **Audit trail**: All questions and responses logged in Langfuse
- ✅ **Safe defaults**: Timeout handling prevents Claude from making risky assumptions

**Deliverables** (added to PRIORITY 3):
- [ ] `ClaudeAgentMessenger` - Two-way messaging for Claude agent
- [ ] `EnhancedClaudeCLIInterface` - Claude CLI with messaging capabilities
- [ ] Question classification logic (critical vs routine)
- [ ] Safe default determination for timeout scenarios
- [ ] Milestone detection and notification triggers
- [ ] Integration tests for Claude ↔ Project Manager interaction
- [ ] Documentation on question patterns and safe defaults

**Timeline**: 1-2 days (8-12h) - to be added to PRIORITY 3 timeline

**Phase 1: Console Messaging Implementation** ⚡ NEW (REQUIRED):

This project implements the two-way messaging system with **console-based notifications** for the project manager UI. This is the foundational messaging channel that supports bidirectional communication for questions and milestone notifications.

**Objectives**:
- Implement console-based messaging for local project manager interaction
- Support rich formatting (colors, emojis, code blocks, panels)
- Enable interactive prompts with validation
- Provide base abstractions for future channel implementations (Phase 2)

### 2. Console Notifier Class

```python
from coffee_maker.autonomous.notifications.channels.console_channel import ConsoleChannel
from typing import Optional

class ConsoleNotifier:
    """Simple console-only notifier for Phase 1"""

    def __init__(self, config: dict = None):
        config = config or {}
        self.console_channel = ConsoleChannel(config.get("console", {"enabled": True}))

    def send_notification(self, notification: dict) -> bool:
        """Send notification to console"""
        return self.console_channel.send_notification(notification)

    def send_milestone(self, notification: dict) -> bool:
        """Send milestone to console"""
        return self.console_channel.send_milestone(notification)

    def collect_input(self, notification: dict, timeout: int = 300) -> Optional[str]:
        """Collect input from console"""
        return self.console_channel.collect_input(notification)
```

**Configuration Example**:

```python
# config/notifications.yaml
notifications:
  console:
    enabled: true
    rich_formatting: true

# Usage
from coffee_maker.autonomous.notifications import ConsoleNotifier

notifier = ConsoleNotifier(config["notifications"])

# Send question to console
notification = {
    "id": "q-001",
    "title": "Claude CLI Agent - Input Required",
    "question": "Should I commit the API key in .env?",
    "options": ["yes", "no", "skip"],
    "priority": "high",
    "timeout": 300
}

notifier.send_notification(notification)
response = notifier.collect_input(notification, timeout=300)

# Send milestone to console
milestone = {
    "id": "m-001",
    "title": "Claude CLI Agent - Milestone",
    "message": "✅ PRIORITY 2 implementation complete",
    "level": "success",
    "details": {
        "tests_passed": "112/112",
        "files_changed": 8,
        "duration": "2.5 hours"
    }
}

notifier.send_milestone(milestone)
```

**Key Features**:

1. **Console Channel**:
   - Rich text formatting with colors and borders
   - Priority-based styling (blue/yellow/orange/red)
   - Interactive prompts with validation
   - Immediate local feedback
   - Emoji support for visual clarity

2. **Extensible Design**:
   - Abstract base classes for future channel implementations (Phase 2)
   - Clean separation of concerns (channel, formatter, input collector)
   - Easy to add new channels without modifying existing code

**Deliverables**:
- [ ] `NotificationChannel` abstract base class
- [ ] `MessageFormatter` abstract base class
- [ ] `InputCollector` abstract base class
- [ ] `ConsoleChannel` implementation with Rich formatting
- [ ] `ConsoleNotifier` orchestrator
- [ ] Configuration system for channel settings
- [ ] Unit tests for console channel
- [ ] Integration tests with mock Claude CLI interactions
- [ ] Documentation on usage and configuration
- [ ] Example configurations for common use cases

**Timeline**: 1.5-2 days (12-16h)
- Day 1: Base classes and console channel (8-10h)
- Day 2: Notifier orchestration, testing, and documentation (4-6h)

**Dependencies**:
```bash
pip install rich
```

**Benefits of Phase 1**:
- ✅ **Immediate value**: Console notifications work out of the box
- ✅ **Foundation for Phase 2**: Clean architecture ready for Slack integration
- ✅ **No external dependencies**: Works without internet or Slack account
- ✅ **Simple setup**: Zero configuration required for basic usage

---

**Phase 2: Slack Integration** ⚡ NEW (OPTIONAL):

This project extends the messaging system with **Slack integration**, enabling remote/mobile notifications and responses. Built on top of Phase 1's abstractions, this allows the project manager to interact with Claude from anywhere via Slack.

**Objectives**:
- Implement Slack channel using Slack SDK and Block Kit
- Add interactive buttons for quick responses
- Set up webhook handler for button click events
- Provide comprehensive setup documentation for Slack app configuration
- Enable multi-channel orchestration (console + Slack simultaneously)
- Support "first response wins" pattern (project manager can respond via any channel)

**Architecture Extension**:

# Slack Integration Setup Guide

## Overview

This guide walks you through setting up Slack integration for Claude CLI notifications.
Follow these steps carefully to enable remote notifications and interactive responses.

## Prerequisites

- Slack workspace where you have admin permissions
- Public URL for webhook endpoint (use ngrok for development)
- Python environment with `slack-sdk` and `flask` installed

## Step 1: Create Slack App

1. Go to https://api.slack.com/apps
2. Click "Create New App"
3. Choose "From scratch"
4. App Name: "Claude CLI Notifications"
5. Workspace: Select your workspace
6. Click "Create App"

## Step 2: Configure Bot Permissions

1. In your app settings, go to "OAuth & Permissions"
2. Scroll to "Scopes" → "Bot Token Scopes"
3. Add the following scopes:
   - `chat:write` - Send messages
   - `chat:write.public` - Send to public channels
   - `channels:read` - List channels
   - `groups:read` - List private channels

4. Scroll up and click "Install to Workspace"
5. Click "Allow"
6. Copy the "Bot User OAuth Token" (starts with `xoxb-`)

## Step 3: Save Bot Token

Add token to your `.env` file:

```bash
SLACK_BOT_TOKEN=xoxb-your-token-here
SLACK_CHANNEL_ID=#claude-notifications
```

## Step 4: Create Notification Channel

1. In Slack, create a new channel: `#claude-notifications`
2. Invite the bot: Type `/invite @Claude CLI Notifications` in the channel

## Step 5: Set Up Webhook Endpoint

### For Development (using ngrok):

```bash
# Install ngrok
brew install ngrok  # macOS
# or download from https://ngrok.com

# Start webhook server
python coffee_maker/autonomous/notifications/webhook/server.py

# In another terminal, expose it
ngrok http 5000

# Copy the HTTPS URL (e.g., https://abc123.ngrok.io)
```

### For Production:

Deploy webhook server to your hosting provider (Heroku, AWS, etc.)
Ensure HTTPS is enabled.

## Step 6: Configure Interactive Components

1. Go back to your Slack app settings
2. Navigate to "Interactivity & Shortcuts"
3. Toggle "Interactivity" ON
4. Set "Request URL" to: `https://your-domain.com/slack/events`
5. Click "Save Changes"

## Step 7: Test the Integration

```python
from coffee_maker.autonomous.notifications import MultiChannelNotifier

config = {
    "console": {"enabled": True},
    "slack": {
        "enabled": True,
        "bot_token": "xoxb-your-token",
        "channel_id": "#claude-notifications"
    }
}

notifier = MultiChannelNotifier(config)

# Send test notification
notifier.send_notification({
    "id": "test-001",
    "title": "Test Notification",
    "question": "Is Slack integration working?",
    "options": ["yes", "no"],
    "priority": "medium",
    "timeout": 300
})

# Check Slack channel for the message with buttons
```

## Step 8: Verify Button Responses

1. Click a button in Slack
2. Check webhook server logs for incoming request
3. Message should update to show "✅ Response received: yes"

## Troubleshooting

### "Bot not found" error
- Make sure bot is invited to the channel: `/invite @Claude CLI Notifications`

### Buttons not working
- Verify webhook URL in "Interactivity & Shortcuts"
- Check webhook server logs for errors
- Ensure HTTPS is used (not HTTP)

### Messages not sent
- Verify bot token is correct
- Check bot has `chat:write` scope
- Ensure channel ID is correct (starts with # or C)

## Security Best Practices

1. **Never commit tokens**: Use `.env` file, add to `.gitignore`
2. **Verify requests**: Add Slack signature verification in webhook handler
3. **Use HTTPS only**: No HTTP in production
4. **Rotate tokens**: If compromised, regenerate in Slack app settings

## Advanced: Signature Verification

```python
import hmac
import hashlib

def verify_slack_request(request):
    """Verify request is from Slack"""

    slack_signature = request.headers.get("X-Slack-Signature")
    slack_timestamp = request.headers.get("X-Slack-Request-Timestamp")
    slack_signing_secret = os.getenv("SLACK_SIGNING_SECRET")

    # Verify timestamp (prevent replay attacks)
    if abs(time.time() - int(slack_timestamp)) > 60 * 5:
        return False

    # Compute signature
    sig_basestring = f"v0:{slack_timestamp}:{request.get_data().decode()}"
    computed_signature = "v0=" + hmac.new(
        slack_signing_secret.encode(),
        sig_basestring.encode(),
        hashlib.sha256
    ).hexdigest()

    return hmac.compare_digest(computed_signature, slack_signature)
```

## Support

For issues, see:
- Slack API docs: https://api.slack.com/docs
- Slack SDK docs: https://slack.dev/python-slack-sdk/
```

**Deliverables**:
- [ ] `SlackChannel` implementation with Block Kit
- [ ] `MultiChannelNotifier` orchestrator (console + Slack)
- [ ] Slack webhook handler (Flask/FastAPI)
- [ ] Signature verification for security
- [ ] `slack_setup_guide.md` with step-by-step instructions
- [ ] Configuration templates and examples
- [ ] Unit tests for Slack channel
- [ ] Integration tests for multi-channel scenarios
- [ ] Troubleshooting documentation
- [ ] Example deployment configs (Heroku, AWS, etc.)

**Timeline**: 2-3 days (16-20h)
- Day 1: Slack channel implementation and Block Kit formatting (8-10h)
- Day 2: Webhook handler and multi-channel orchestration (5-7h)
- Day 3: Comprehensive documentation and testing (3-4h)

**Dependencies**:
```bash
pip install slack-sdk flask requests
```

**Environment Variables**:
```bash
# .env
SLACK_BOT_TOKEN=xoxb-your-bot-token
SLACK_CHANNEL_ID=#claude-notifications
SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL=https://your-domain.com/slack/events
SLACK_SIGNING_SECRET=your-signing-secret  # For signature verification
```

**Benefits of Phase 2**:
- ✅ **Mobile access**: Respond to Claude from phone via Slack app
- ✅ **Remote work**: No need to be at console
- ✅ **Persistent history**: All notifications logged in Slack
- ✅ **Team visibility**: Other team members can see Claude's progress
- ✅ **Quick responses**: Interactive buttons for instant replies
- ✅ **Multi-channel flexibility**: Use console or Slack, whichever is convenient

**Implementation Decision Questions & Work-Around Strategy** ⚡ **INTELLIGENT BLOCKING**

**Problem**: Sometimes Claude encounters decisions that require human judgment (e.g., "Should we use SQLAlchemy or sqlite3?"). The daemon should:
1. **Ask the question intelligently** (with analysis and recommendations)
2. **Continue working on other tasks** while waiting for an answer
3. **Resume blocked task** once decision is made

**Solution: Question Queue + Task Dependency Tracking**

```python
from coffee_maker.autonomous.decision_queue import DecisionQueue, TaskDependency

class IntelligentDaemon:
    """Daemon that asks questions and works around blocked tasks"""

    def __init__(self):
        self.decision_queue = DecisionQueue()
        self.task_graph = TaskDependency()

    def encounter_decision_point(self, question: str, context: dict):
        """Claude encounters a decision that needs user input"""

        # 1. Create decision request with full analysis
        decision = self.decision_queue.create_decision(
            question=question,
            priority="PRIORITY_1",  # Current task
            context=context,
            analysis={
                "options": [

                    {
                        "name": "Option 2: Use native sqlite3",
                        "pros": ["Zero dependencies", "Lighter", "Sufficient for use case"],

**Task Dependency Graph**:

```python
class TaskDependency:
    """Tracks task dependencies and finds independent work"""

    def __init__(self):
        # Task dependency graph
        self.dependencies = {
            "PRIORITY_1": {
                "depends_on": [],  # No dependencies

**Example Workflow**:

```python
# Daemon is working on PRIORITY 1 (Analytics)
daemon.start_task("PRIORITY_1")

# Claude encounters decision point while implementing analytics module
decision = daemon.encounter_decision_point(
    question="Should we use SQLAlchemy or native sqlite3?",
    context={
        "current_code_size": "~500 lines using SQLAlchemy",
        "usage": "Only in standalone scripts",
        "current_dependencies": ["sqlalchemy==2.0.x"]
    }
)

# Daemon creates structured decision request with analysis
# Notifies user via Slack/terminal
# Marks PRIORITY_1 as blocked

# Meanwhile, daemon finds independent work:
independent_tasks = [
    "PRIORITY_2: Project Manager CLI",
    "PRIORITY_2.5: UX Documentation",
    "Code refactoring: Sprint 5"
]

# Daemon starts working on PRIORITY 2 while waiting for decision
daemon.start_task("PRIORITY_2")

# ... hours later, user responds: "Option 2"
decision.set_answer("Option 2: Use sqlite3")

# Daemon is notified of decision
daemon.on_decision_answered(decision)

# Daemon completes current task (PRIORITY 2.cli_framework)
# Then returns to blocked task (PRIORITY_1) with user's decision
daemon.resume_task("PRIORITY_1", decision="Option 2")

# Continues implementing analytics module with sqlite3
```

**Decision Database Schema**:

```sql
CREATE TABLE decision_queue (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    priority TEXT NOT NULL,           -- Which priority this affects
    task TEXT NOT NULL,                -- Specific task blocked
    question TEXT NOT NULL,            -- Question for user
    context JSON,                      -- Context/analysis data
    options JSON,                      -- Array of options with pros/cons
    recommended_option TEXT,           -- Claude's recommendation
    reasoning TEXT,                    -- Why this recommendation
    estimated_impact TEXT,             -- Time/effort estimate
    created_at DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    answered_at DATETIME,
    user_answer TEXT,                  -- User's choice
    status TEXT DEFAULT 'pending',     -- pending/answered/expired
    workaround_tasks JSON              -- Tasks daemon worked on while waiting
);

CREATE TABLE blocked_tasks (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    task_name TEXT NOT NULL,
    blocked_by_decision_id INTEGER REFERENCES decision_queue(id),
    blocked_since DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    resumed_at DATETIME,
    total_blocked_duration_seconds INTEGER
);
```

**Benefits**:
- ✅ **Intelligent blocking**: Daemon doesn't waste time waiting
- ✅ **Structured decisions**: User gets full analysis, not just raw question
- ✅ **Work continuity**: Other tasks progress while blocked task waits
- ✅ **Audit trail**: All decisions logged with context
- ✅ **Resumable**: Daemon seamlessly resumes blocked task with user's decision
- ✅ **Transparency**: User sees what daemon is doing while waiting
- ✅ **Efficiency**: Maximizes productive time, minimizes idle time

**Integration with Notification System**:

Decision requests use the same notification infrastructure (Slack, terminal, email) but with specialized formatting that includes:
- Full analysis with pros/cons
- Recommendation with reasoning
- Impact estimate
- While-you-decide status (what daemon is working on)

This transforms the daemon from a **sequential executor** into an **intelligent parallel worker** that maximizes productivity even when blocked.

### 🎯 Git Best Practices

1. **Atomic commits**: 1 commit = 1 logical change
2. **Descriptive messages**: Explain the "why", not the "what"
3. **Daily push**: Backup and visibility on progress
4. **Short branches**: Merge regularly (< 1 week of work)
5. **Tags on milestones**: Facilitates rollback and tracking
6. **Up-to-date CHANGELOG**: Document changes for users
7. **Review before merge**: Verify tests pass and code is clean

### 🚨 What to Avoid

- ❌ Too large commits (> 500 lines modified)
- ❌ Vague messages ("fix bug", "update code")
- ❌ Direct commits on main (always use a branch)
- ❌ Forgetting to push (risk of work loss)
- ❌ Merging untested code
- ❌ Keeping feature branches open too long

- Are battle-tested in production
- Have extensive documentation and examples
- Are actively maintained
- Have stable APIs

### 📋 Pre-Implementation Checklist

Before starting any new priority, **MANDATORY** analysis:

#### 1. **Evaluate Current Stack** (30min-1h)
- [ ] Review existing dependencies in `requirements.txt` / `pyproject.toml`
- [ ] Identify which existing libraries can be reused
- [ ] Check if current stack already provides the needed functionality
- [ ] Avoid adding new dependencies if existing ones can solve the problem

- [ ] Search for industry-standard solutions for the problem domain
- [ ] Consult GitHub trending, PyPI stats, and community recommendations
- [ ] Read recent blog posts and tutorials (last 1-2 years)
- [ ] Check StackOverflow for common patterns and gotchas

#### 3. **Dependency Evaluation Criteria**

For each potential new dependency, evaluate:

| Criterion | Threshold | Why It Matters |
|-----------|-----------|----------------|
| **GitHub Stars** | > 5,000 | Community adoption indicator |
| **Weekly Downloads** | > 100,000 (PyPI) | Production usage indicator |
| **Last Commit** | < 6 months | Active maintenance |
| **Open Issues** | < 500 unresolved | Maintainer responsiveness |

2. Create a technology decision document in `docs/tech_decisions/`
3. Justify each new dependency with evaluation criteria
4. Prefer existing dependencies over new ones
5. Update this section if new standard technologies emerge

---

## 🔄 Continuous Improvement Practice (Between Each Project)

**Principle**: After each completed project, take time to improve existing code before starting the next one.

### 📋 Continuous Improvement Checklist

To do **systematically** between each project:

#### 0. **Technology Stack Review** (30min-1h) ⚡ NEW
- [ ] Review dependencies added during the project
- [ ] Verify all new dependencies meet the criteria in "Technology Selection Guidelines"
- [ ] Document technology decisions in `docs/tech_decisions/`
- [ ] Check for unused dependencies and remove them
- [ ] Update dependency versions to latest stable releases (if safe)
- [ ] Ensure all dependencies are properly documented in requirements

**Reference**: See **Technology Selection Guidelines** section above

#### 1. **Refactoring Analysis** (2-4h)
- [ ] Identify refactoring opportunities in recently written code
- [ ] Look for code duplications (DRY violations)
- [ ] Detect functions/classes that are too long or complex
- [ ] Spot circular dependencies or tight couplings
- [ ] Verify consistency of patterns used

**Tools**:
```bash
# Complexity analysis
radon cc coffee_maker/ -a -nb

# Duplication detection
pylint coffee_maker/ --disable=all --enable=duplicate-code

# Static analysis
mypy coffee_maker/
```

**Best Practice - Parallel Claude Instance for Deep Refactoring** ⚡ NEW:

For major refactoring work, consider using a **parallel Claude instance** dedicated to simplification:

```
User Workflow:
1. Main Claude instance: Works on feature implementation
2. Parallel Claude instance: Simultaneously simplifies and removes redundancies
3. Coordination: Merge simplification work before starting next priority

Benefits:
- ✅ Continuous code quality improvement
- ✅ No interruption to feature development
- ✅ Deeper analysis and more thorough refactoring
- ✅ Fresh perspective on code organization
- ✅ Parallel work = faster overall progress

Example:
- Instance A (this conversation): Planning PRIORITY 2 (Autonomous Daemon)
- Instance B (parallel): Simplifying codebase, removing redundancies
- Result: Clean foundation ready for autonomous daemon to work with
```

**Real-World Example: Sprint 1 Improvements** ⚡ ACTUAL WORK DONE:

Sprint 1 (completed 2025-01-09) demonstrates the type of refactoring opportunities to look for:

**1. Replace Manual Retry Logic with Centralized Utilities**:
```python
# BEFORE (18 lines, repeated pattern):
def set_api_limits(providers_fallback):
    def _run_with_api_limits(self, **kwargs):
        attempt = 0
        while attempt < 3:
            try:
                return self.invoke(**kwargs)
            except openai.error.RateLimitError as e:
                print("Rate limit reached, waiting before retrying...")
                time.sleep(2**attempt)  # exponential backoff
                attempt += 1
        return providers_fallback("openai", self, **kwargs)

# AFTER (cleaner, observable, 21 lines but better structure):
@with_retry(
    max_attempts=3,
    backoff_base=2.0,
    retriable_exceptions=(openai.error.RateLimitError,),
)
def _invoke_with_retry():
    return self.invoke(**kwargs)

try:
    return _invoke_with_retry()
except RetryExhausted as e:
    logger.warning(f"Rate limit retry exhausted: {e.original_error}")
    return providers_fallback("openai", self, **kwargs)
```

**Benefits**: Langfuse observability, proper logging, type safety, consistent with codebase

**2. Extract Duplicate Code to Reusable Utilities**:
```python
# BEFORE (9 lines repeated 3x = 27 lines total across cost_calculator.py):
now = time.time()
if timeframe == "day":
    threshold = now - 86400  # 24 hours
elif timeframe == "hour":
    threshold = now - 3600  # 1 hour
elif timeframe == "minute":
    threshold = now - 60  # 1 minute
else:  # "all"
    threshold = 0

# AFTER (1 line, reusable utility in time_utils.py):
threshold = get_timestamp_threshold(timeframe)

# New utility function:
def get_timestamp_threshold(
    timeframe: str,
    reference_time: Optional[float] = None,
) -> float:
    """Get Unix timestamp threshold for a timeframe.

    Args:
        timeframe: One of "minute", "hour", "day", or "all"
        reference_time: Reference Unix timestamp (default: current time)

    Returns:
        Unix timestamp threshold

    Raises:
        ValueError: If timeframe is invalid
    """
    # Implementation...
```

**Savings**: 27 lines → 3 lines (24 lines eliminated)

**3. Add Retry Protection to Flaky Database Operations**:
```python
# BEFORE (no retry protection, vulnerable to deadlocks/timeouts):
def get_llm_performance(self, days: int = 7, model: Optional[str] = None) -> Dict:
    """Get LLM performance metrics."""
    # Database query...

# AFTER (retry + observability):
@observe
@with_retry(
    max_attempts=3,
    backoff_base=1.5,
    retriable_exceptions=(OperationalError, TimeoutError),
)
def get_llm_performance(self, days: int = 7, model: Optional[str] = None) -> Dict:
    """Get LLM performance metrics."""
    # Same query, now resilient to transient failures
```

**Impact**: Added to 7 database query methods in analytics/analyzer.py
- Handles database deadlocks automatically
- Handles connection pool exhaustion
- All operations tracked in Langfuse

**4. Delete Deprecated Code**:
```python
# DELETED FILES (800 lines removed):
- coffee_maker/langchain_observe/_deprecated/auto_picker_llm.py (739 lines)
- coffee_maker/langchain_observe/_deprecated/create_auto_picker.py (61 lines)
- coffee_maker/langchain_observe/_deprecated/ (entire directory)
```

**Rationale**: Keeping deprecated code causes confusion and maintenance burden

**Sprint 1 Metrics**:
- ✅ **800+ lines removed** (deprecated code + duplication)
- ✅ **27 lines of duplication eliminated**
- ✅ **11 critical methods** now observable in Langfuse
- ✅ **10+ flaky operations** now have retry protection
- ✅ **15+ new type annotations** added
- ✅ **112 tests passing** (no regressions)

**Key Refactoring Opportunities to Look For**:
1. **Manual retry loops** → Replace with `@with_retry` decorator
2. **Duplicate calculations** → Extract to reusable utility functions
3. **Missing observability** → Add `@observe` decorator to critical methods
4. **Flaky database operations** → Add retry protection with proper exceptions
5. **Print statements** → Replace with proper logging (`logger.warning()`, etc.)
6. **Missing type hints** → Add type annotations for better IDE support
7. **Deprecated/dead code** → Delete unused files and functions
8. **Hard-coded values** → Extract to named constants
9. **Complex conditions** → Simplify with early returns and guard clauses
10. **Long functions** → Split into smaller, focused functions

**Documentation**: See `docs/sprint1_improvements_summary.md` for complete Sprint 1 report

#### 2. **Complexity Reduction** (1-3h)
- [ ] Extract long methods into smaller functions
- [ ] Simplify complex conditions (early returns, guard clauses)
- [ ] Reduce cyclomatic complexity (< 10 per function)
- [ ] Replace magic numbers with named constants
- [ ] Improve readability (variable names, structure)

**Quality Criteria**:
- Cyclomatic complexity < 10
- Function length < 50 lines
- Class length < 300 lines
- Indentation depth < 4 levels

#### 3. **Documentation** (1-2h)
- [ ] Add/complete missing docstrings
- [ ] Enrich usage examples
- [ ] Update README if necessary

```

#### 4. **Tests and Coverage** (1-2h)
- [ ] Verify test coverage (target: > 80%)
- [ ] Add tests for missing edge cases
- [ ] Refactor duplicated tests
- [ ] Verify tests are readable and maintainable

**Commands**:
```bash
pytest --cov=coffee_maker --cov-report=html
coverage report --fail-under=80
```

#### 5. **Performance and Optimization** (1-2h - if relevant)
- [ ] Identify potential bottlenecks
- [ ] Check for unnecessary imports
- [ ] Optimize DB queries if applicable
- [ ] Check memory usage for high volumes

#### 6. **Cleanup** (30min-1h)
- [ ] Remove dead code (unused functions/classes)
- [ ] Clean unused imports
- [ ] Remove obsolete comments
- [ ] Format code (black, isort)
- [ ] Check TODOs and handle or document them

**Commands**:
```bash
# Automatic cleanup
black coffee_maker/
isort coffee_maker/
autoflake --remove-all-unused-imports --in-place --recursive coffee_maker/
```

#### 7. **Git Management and Versioning** (30min-1h)
- [ ] Create atomic and well-named commits
- [ ] Use feature branches for each subtask
- [ ] Make regular commits (at least daily)
- [ ] Write descriptive commit messages
- [ ] Create tags for important milestones

**Git Best Practices**:
```bash
# Branch naming convention
feature/analytics-exporter
feature/streamlit-dashboard
fix/rate-limiting-bug
refactor/simplify-fallback-strategy

# Commit message convention
# Format: <type>(<scope>): <description>
# Types: feat, fix, refactor, docs, test, chore, perf

## 🚫 Anti-Priorities (to avoid for now)

- ❌ **Complete rewrite** - Sprint 1 & 2 refactoring is sufficient
- ❌ **Premature optimizations** - Focus on business features
- ❌ **Support for all LLM providers** - Stick to current 3 (OpenAI, Gemini, Anthropic)
- ❌ **Complex UI/Frontend** - Streamlit is sufficient, no need for React/Vue.js for now

---

## 🔄 Flexibility and Adaptation

This roadmap is **flexible** and can be adjusted based on:
- User feedback
- Business priorities
- New technological opportunities
- Time/resource constraints

**Recommended review**: Every month, re-evaluate priorities.

## ✅ Recommended Decision

**To start immediately**:

### **The New Paradigm: Build the Self-Building System First** 🤖

1. ✅ **Week 1-3** (Month 1): Implement **Analytics & Langfuse Export** 🔴 PRIORITY 1
   - **Why first**: Foundation for daemon to track its own work
   - Immediate business impact (ROI measurement)
   - Critical multi-process rate limiting
   - **Timeline**: 2-3 weeks

2. ✅ **Week 4** (Month 1): **Basic Autonomous Development Daemon** 🔴 PRIORITY 2 ⚡ **GAME CHANGER** 🤖
   - **Revolutionary**: Self-implementing AI system that NEVER stops
   - **Minimal and focused**: Just enough to autonomously implement features
   - Claude reads ROADMAP.md and implements priorities continuously
   - Automatic branch creation, commits, PRs, progress tracking
   - **Timeline**: 3-5 days (~20-30h)
   - **Impact**: After this, **YOU ONLY PLAN - CLAUDE BUILDS EVERYTHING** 🚀
