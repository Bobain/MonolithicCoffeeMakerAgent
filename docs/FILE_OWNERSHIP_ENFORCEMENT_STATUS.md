# File Ownership Enforcement - Current Status

**Date**: 2025-10-24
**Status**: ✅ Partially Implemented

---

## Summary

File ownership enforcement (CFR-001) is **partially implemented** with two layers:

1. **✅ File-level enforcement**: Generator and file tools check ownership before writes
2. **✅ Database-level enforcement**: RoadmapDatabase enforces `project_manager` write permissions
3. **⚠️  NOT YET**: Database table-level row access control per agent

---

## Current Implementation

### 1. File-Level Enforcement ✅

**Location**: `coffee_maker/autonomous/ace/file_ownership.py`

**How it works**:
- `FileOwnership.get_owner(file_path)` → Returns owning agent
- `FileOwnership.check_ownership(agent, file_path)` → Returns true/false
- Raises `OwnershipViolationError` if violation detected

**Enforcement points**:
- `coffee_maker/autonomous/ace/generator.py` - Checks ownership before file writes
- `coffee_maker/autonomous/ace/file_tools.py` - Validates ownership in file operations

**Example**:
```python
from coffee_maker.autonomous.ace.file_ownership import FileOwnership

# Check ownership
owner = FileOwnership.get_owner(".claude/CLAUDE.md")
# Returns: AgentType.CODE_DEVELOPER

# Validate before write
FileOwnership.check_ownership(
    AgentType.PROJECT_MANAGER,  # Attempting agent
    ".claude/CLAUDE.md",        # Target file
    raise_on_violation=True     # Raises if wrong agent
)
# Raises: OwnershipViolationError (PM can't modify CODE_DEVELOPER files)
```

**Test coverage**: `tests/unit/test_file_ownership_enforcement.py` (30+ tests)

---

### 2. Database-Level Enforcement ✅

**Location**: `coffee_maker/autonomous/roadmap_database.py`

**How it works**:
```python
class RoadmapDatabase:
    def __init__(self, agent_name: str):
        self.agent_name = agent_name
        self.can_write = agent_name == "project_manager"  # Only PM can write
```

**Enforcement**:
- Read operations: All agents allowed
- Write operations: Only `project_manager` allowed
- Raises `PermissionError` if non-PM tries to write

**Example**:
```python
# project_manager can write
db = RoadmapDatabase(agent_name="project_manager")
db.update_status("US-062", "✅ Complete", "project_manager")  # ✅ Success

# code_developer CANNOT write
db = RoadmapDatabase(agent_name="code_developer")
db.update_status("US-062", "✅ Complete", "code_developer")
# Raises: PermissionError("Only project_manager can create items, not code_developer")
```

**Enforced methods**:
- `create_item()` - Raises PermissionError if not PM
- `export_to_file()` - Raises PermissionError if not PM
- All write operations check `self.can_write`

---

## What's NOT Implemented ⚠️

### Database Table-Level Row Access Control

**Current gap**:
- Database write access is **binary** (project_manager yes, everyone else no)
- No granular control like "architect can write to `technical_specs` table only"
- No row-level security (RLS) like "agent X can only update rows where created_by = 'X'"

**Example of what's missing**:
```python
# Would be nice to have:
db = RoadmapDatabase(agent_name="architect")
db.create_technical_spec(...)  # ✅ Allowed (architect owns specs)
db.update_roadmap_item(...)     # ❌ Blocked (PM owns roadmap items)

# Currently:
db = RoadmapDatabase(agent_name="architect")
db.create_technical_spec(...)   # ❌ Blocked (not PM)
db.update_roadmap_item(...)     # ❌ Blocked (not PM)
```

---

## Why This Is Acceptable (For Now)

1. **File-level enforcement prevents most conflicts**:
   - Files are the primary unit of work
   - Database is mostly metadata

2. **project_manager as single writer is correct**:
   - ROADMAP is owned by PM (CFR-001)
   - Other agents request changes via notifications
   - PM approves and executes changes

3. **Granular database control is future work**:
   - Would add complexity
   - Current model prevents conflicts effectively
   - Can be added when needed (e.g., for `technical_specs` table ownership by architect)

---

## Future Enhancement: Table-Level Access Control

**If we want granular database control**, implement table ownership:

```python
TABLE_OWNERSHIP = {
    "roadmap_items": AgentType.PROJECT_MANAGER,
    "technical_specs": AgentType.ARCHITECT,
    "code_reviews": AgentType.CODE_REVIEWER,
    "implementation_commits": AgentType.CODE_DEVELOPER,
}

class RoadmapDatabase:
    def _check_table_permission(self, table_name: str, operation: str):
        """Check if agent can access table."""
        owner = TABLE_OWNERSHIP.get(table_name)

        if operation == "read":
            return True  # All agents can read

        if operation == "write":
            if self.agent_name == owner.value:
                return True
            raise PermissionError(
                f"{self.agent_name} cannot write to {table_name} "
                f"(owned by {owner.value})"
            )
```

**Complexity**: Medium
**Benefit**: High (more granular control, better multi-agent parallelism)
**Priority**: Low (current enforcement is sufficient)

---

## Test Coverage

### File Ownership Tests ✅
- `tests/unit/test_file_ownership_enforcement.py` - 30+ tests
- Covers: lookup, violations, edge cases, CFR compliance

### Database Permission Tests ⚠️
- **TODO**: Add tests for database write permission enforcement
- Should test: PermissionError raised for non-PM writes
- Should test: Notification-based update workflow

---

## Recommendation

**Current enforcement is adequate** for preventing file conflicts (CFR-000):

1. ✅ File writes are checked by generator (US-038)
2. ✅ Database writes are restricted to project_manager
3. ✅ Other agents use notification system to request changes
4. ⚠️  Table-level granularity is future enhancement (not critical)

**Action items**:
1. ✅ File enforcement - COMPLETE
2. ✅ Database enforcement - COMPLETE (binary PM-only)
3. ⚠️  Table-level enforcement - OPTIONAL (future work)
4. ⚠️  Add database permission tests - TODO

---

**Conclusion**: The system prevents file conflicts effectively. Table-level database access control would be nice-to-have but is not critical for current operations.
