## 1. Introduction to ACE Framework

### What is ACE?

**ACE (Agentic Context Engineering)** is a framework built into the MonolithicCoffeeMakerAgent system that manages how autonomous agents interact with files and enforce architectural boundaries.

### Core Components

The ACE framework consists of one primary agent:

| Component | Purpose | Primary Responsibility |
|-----------|---------|------------------------|
| **Generator** | File operation interceptor | Intercepts all file operations, enforces ownership rules (CFR-001), auto-delegates to correct owners, logs traces for analysis |

### Why Use ACE?

**Problem Without ACE:**
- Agents step on each other's toes
- `project_manager` overwrites `code_developer` files
- `assistant` modifies files they don't own
- Chaos, conflicts, merge nightmares

**Solution With ACE:**
- ‚úÖ Automatic ownership enforcement (CFR-001)
- ‚úÖ Zero-configuration delegation
- ‚úÖ Transparent to requesting agents
- ‚úÖ Complete observability via traces
- ‚úÖ No file conflicts between agents

### When to Use Each Feature

| Feature | When to Use |
|---------|-------------|
| **Generator Interception** | Every time an agent writes/edits/deletes a file |
| **Context-Upfront** | Loading required files for agent execution |
| **Search Monitoring** | Tracking when agents search for files (detecting insufficient context) |
| **Delegation Traces** | Analyzing ownership violation patterns |

---

## 2. Prerequisites & Setup

### Required Installations

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Bobain/MonolithicCoffeeMakerAgent.git
cd MonolithicCoffeeMakerAgent

# Install dependencies
poetry install

# Activate environment
poetry shell

# Verify installation
python -c "from coffee_maker.autonomous.ace.generator import Generator; print('‚úÖ ACE Generator installed')"
```

**Expected Output:**
```
‚úÖ ACE Generator installed
```

### Environment Variables

The ACE Generator requires access to the orchestrator database:

```bash
# Verify database exists
ls -la data/orchestrator.db
```

**Expected Output:**
```
-rw-r--r--  1 user  staff  245760 Oct 20 10:30 data/orchestrator.db
```

If missing, initialize it:

```bash
# Run database migration
python coffee_maker/orchestrator/migrate_add_generator_traces.py
```

### First-Time Configuration

The Generator is automatically initialized when agents start. No manual configuration required!

### Verification Steps

```bash
# Start Python shell
python

# Import and test Generator
>>> from coffee_maker.autonomous.ace.generator import get_generator
>>> generator = get_generator()
>>> print(f"Generator ready: {generator is not None}")
```

**Expected Output:**
```python
Generator ready: True
```

## 3. Tutorial 1: Understanding the Generator

### What Generator Does

The **Generator** is the guardian of file ownership. It:

1. **Intercepts** every file write/edit/delete operation
2. **Checks** ownership using the FileOwnership registry
3. **Delegates** to the correct owner if violation detected
4. **Logs** delegation traces for analysis
5. **Returns** results transparently to the requesting agent

### How to Invoke Generator

The Generator is **automatic**. You don't invoke it directly - it intercepts operations transparently.

### Example: Capture Trace from code_developer

Let's see the Generator in action when `project_manager` tries to write to a file owned by `code_developer`:

```python
from coffee_maker.autonomous.ace.generator import Generator
from coffee_maker.autonomous.agent_registry import AgentType

# Initialize Generator
generator = Generator()

# Simulate project_manager trying to write to code_developer's file
result = generator.intercept_file_operation(
    agent_type=AgentType.PROJECT_MANAGER,
    file_path="coffee_maker/cli/test.py",
    operation="write",
    content="# Test code"
)

# Check results
print(f"Success: {result.success}")
print(f"Delegated: {result.delegated}")
print(f"Delegated to: {result.delegated_to.value if result.delegated else 'None'}")
print(f"Trace ID: {result.trace_id}")
```

**Expected Output:**
```
Success: True
Delegated: True
Delegated to: code_developer
Trace ID: delegation_20251020_103045_123456
```

### Interpreting the Trace Output

| Field | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| `success: True` | Operation completed successfully |
| `delegated: True` | Operation was delegated to another agent |
| `delegated_to: code_developer` | The agent that actually performed the operation |
| `trace_id: delegation_...` | Unique ID for retrieving full trace details |

### Where Traces Are Stored

Traces are stored in **two locations**:

1. **In-Memory** (during session):
   ```python
   generator.delegation_traces  # List of DelegationTrace objects
   ```

2. **SQLite Database** (persistent):
   ```bash
   sqlite3 data/orchestrator.db "SELECT * FROM generator_traces LIMIT 5;"
   ```

---

## 4. Tutorial 2: File Ownership Enforcement

### What is File Ownership?

Every file in the project is "owned" by one agent. Ownership is defined in `coffee_maker/autonomous/ace/file_ownership.py`:

```python
from coffee_maker.autonomous.ace.file_ownership import FileOwnership
from coffee_maker.autonomous.agent_registry import AgentType

# Check who owns a file
owner = FileOwnership.get_owner("docs/roadmap/ROADMAP.md")
print(f"Owner: {owner.value}")  # project_manager

owner = FileOwnership.get_owner("coffee_maker/cli/user_listener.py")
print(f"Owner: {owner.value}")  # code_developer

owner = FileOwnership.get_owner(".claude/agents/architect.md")
print(f"Owner: {owner.value}")  # architect
```

### Ownership Rules (CFR-001)

**Read Operations**: Always allowed (no ownership check)

**Write/Edit/Delete Operations**: Checked against ownership

| Agent | Owns |
|-------|------|
| `code_developer` | `coffee_maker/**/*.py`, `tests/**/*.py` |
| `project_manager` | `docs/roadmap/**/*.md` |
| `architect` | `docs/architecture/**/*.md`, `.claude/agents/*.md` |
| `assistant` | `.claude/commands/**/*.md` |

### Example: Delegation When Owner Mismatch

```python
from coffee_maker.autonomous.ace.generator import Generator
from coffee_maker.autonomous.agent_registry import AgentType

generator = Generator()

# ‚ùå assistant tries to write to architect's file
result = generator.intercept_file_operation(
    agent_type=AgentType.ASSISTANT,
    file_path=".claude/agents/architect.md",
    operation="write",
    content="# Updated architect definition"
)

print(f"Delegated: {result.delegated}")  # True
print(f"Owner: {result.delegated_to.value}")  # architect
```

**Console Output:**
```
INFO: Ownership violation detected: assistant tried to write .claude/agents/architect.md (owner: architect). Auto-delegating...
INFO: Delegation trace logged: delegation_20251020_104512_789012
```

### Understanding Delta Items

**Delta items** are the changes detected between agents' expected ownership and actual operations.

Get delegation statistics:

```python
stats = generator.get_delegation_stats()
print(f"Total delegations: {stats['total_delegations']}")
print(f"By requester: {stats['delegations_by_requesting_agent']}")
print(f"By owner: {stats['delegations_by_owner']}")
print(f"Most common violations: {stats['most_common_violations']}")
```

**Example Output:**
```python
Total delegations: 23
By requester: {'assistant': 12, 'project_manager': 8, 'user_listener': 3}
By owner: {'code_developer': 15, 'architect': 5, 'project_manager': 3}
Most common violations: [
    {'pattern': 'assistant ‚Üí code_developer', 'count': 10},
    {'pattern': 'project_manager ‚Üí code_developer', 'count': 5}
]
```

This tells us:
- `assistant` frequently tries to write code (should delegate to `code_developer`)
- May need to update `assistant` agent definition to not attempt code writing

---

## 5. Tutorial 3: Delegation Traces & Monitoring

### Viewing Delegation Traces

Get all delegations from a specific agent:

```python
from coffee_maker.autonomous.ace.generator import get_generator
from coffee_maker.autonomous.agent_registry import AgentType

generator = get_generator()

# Get delegations from assistant in last 24 hours
traces = generator.get_delegation_traces(
    agent=AgentType.ASSISTANT,
    hours=24
)

for trace in traces:
    print(f"[{trace.timestamp}] {trace.requesting_agent.value} ‚Üí {trace.owner_agent.value}")
    print(f"  File: {trace.file_path}")
    print(f"  Operation: {trace.operation.value}")
    print(f"  Reason: {trace.reason}")
    print()
```

**Example Output:**
```
[2025-10-20 10:45:12] assistant ‚Üí code_developer
  File: coffee_maker/cli/new_feature.py
  Operation: write
  Reason: Ownership violation: assistant tried to access code_developer's file

[2025-10-20 11:22:45] assistant ‚Üí architect
  File: .claude/agents/new_agent.md
  Operation: edit
  Reason: Ownership violation: assistant tried to access architect's file
```

### Complete ACE Workflow

**Workflow: Implementing a Feature with Automatic Delegation**

```python
from coffee_maker.autonomous.ace.generator import Generator
from coffee_maker.autonomous.agent_registry import AgentType

generator = Generator()

# Step 1: Load context for code_developer
context = generator.load_agent_context(AgentType.CODE_DEVELOPER)
print(f"Loaded {len(context)} context files")

# Step 2: Format for prompt
formatted = generator.format_context_for_prompt(context, max_chars_per_file=5000)

# Step 3: Simulate code_developer writing to owned file (ALLOWED)
result1 = generator.intercept_file_operation(
    agent_type=AgentType.CODE_DEVELOPER,
    file_path="coffee_maker/new_module.py",
    operation="write",
    content="# New module"
)
print(f"Write allowed: {not result1.delegated}")  # True (owns the file)

# Step 4: Update ROADMAP (delegated to project_manager)
result2 = generator.intercept_file_operation(
    agent_type=AgentType.CODE_DEVELOPER,
    file_path="docs/roadmap/ROADMAP.md",
    operation="edit",
    content="Updated status"
)
print(f"Delegated: {result2.delegated}")  # True
print(f"Owner: {result2.delegated_to.value}")  # project_manager

# Step 5: View delegation stats
stats = generator.get_delegation_stats()
print(f"Total delegations: {stats['total_delegations']}")
```

### Feedback Loop Demonstration

The ACE system creates a feedback loop:

```
1. Agent tries operation ‚Üí 2. Generator intercepts ‚Üí 3. Checks ownership
                ‚Üë                                              ‚Üì
        7. Agent improves  ‚Üê 6. Patterns identified ‚Üê 4. Logs trace
                ‚Üë                                              ‚Üì
        Analysis reveals patterns                    5. Database stores
```

This loop helps identify:
- Agents that need better ownership awareness
- Files with unclear ownership
- Opportunities to improve agent design

---

## 6. Tutorial 4: Context-Upfront Pattern

### What is Context-Upfront?

Instead of agents **searching** for files (Glob/Grep), they receive **required files upfront** in their initial context.

**Old Pattern (Slow):**
```python
# Agent searches for ROADMAP
files = glob("docs/**/*.md")
for f in files:
    if "ROADMAP" in f:
        content = read(f)
```

**New Pattern (Fast):**
```python
# Generator provides ROADMAP upfront
context = generator.load_agent_context(AgentType.PROJECT_MANAGER)
roadmap = context["docs/roadmap/ROADMAP.md"]  # Already loaded!
```

### Loading Context for an Agent

```python
from coffee_maker.autonomous.ace.generator import Generator
from coffee_maker.autonomous.agent_registry import AgentType

generator = Generator()

# Load context for project_manager
context = generator.load_agent_context(AgentType.PROJECT_MANAGER)

print("Files provided upfront:")
for file_path in context.keys():
    size = len(context[file_path])
    print(f"  - {file_path} ({size:,} chars)")
```

**Example Output:**
```
Files provided upfront:
  - docs/roadmap/ROADMAP.md (1,234,567 chars)
  - docs/roadmap/TEAM_COLLABORATION.md (45,678 chars)
  - docs/roadmap/CRITICAL_FUNCTIONAL_REQUIREMENTS.md (23,456 chars)
  - .claude/CLAUDE.md (12,345 chars)
  - .claude/agents/project_manager.md (8,901 chars)
```

### Formatting Context for Prompts

```python
formatted = generator.format_context_for_prompt(context, max_chars_per_file=5000)
print(formatted[:500])
```

**Output:**
```
=== CONTEXT FILES PROVIDED UPFRONT ===

--- docs/roadmap/ROADMAP.md ---
# MonolithicCoffeeMakerAgent - Master Roadmap

**Last Updated**: 2025-10-20
...

--- docs/roadmap/TEAM_COLLABORATION.md ---
# Team Collaboration Methodology
...

=== END CONTEXT FILES ===

You have all required context above. Use Read tool for specific line ranges if needed, but do NOT search with Glob/Grep for these known files.
```

### Benefits of Context-Upfront

| Before | After |
|--------|-------|
| 5+ file searches per task | 0 searches (files provided) |
| 30-60 seconds searching | Instant access |
| Higher token usage | Lower token usage |
| Agent wastes time | Agent focuses on work |

---

## 7. Tutorial 5: Search Monitoring

### Monitoring File Searches

The Generator tracks when agents use Glob/Grep, which may indicate insufficient context:

```python
from coffee_maker.autonomous.ace.generator import Generator
from coffee_maker.autonomous.agent_registry import AgentType

generator = Generator()

# Simulate code_developer searching for test files
generator.monitor_file_search(
    agent_type=AgentType.CODE_DEVELOPER,
    operation="glob",
    file_pattern="tests/**/*test*.py",
    context_provided=True  # Context WAS provided upfront
)

# Get search statistics
stats = generator.get_search_stats()
print(f"Total searches: {stats['total_searches']}")
print(f"Unexpected searches: {stats['unexpected_searches']}")
print(f"By agent: {stats['searches_by_agent']}")
```

**Console Output:**
```
WARNING: Unexpected file search: code_developer used glob for 'tests/**/*test*.py'. Consider adding to required context files in agent definition.

Total searches: 1
Unexpected searches: 1
By agent: {'code_developer': 1}
```

### Interpreting Search Logs

| Severity | Meaning | Action |
|----------|---------|--------|
| **INFO** | Expected search (assistant (using code analysis skills) or architect analysis) | None needed |
| **WARNING** | Unexpected search (context was provided) | Add file to agent's required context |

### Improving Agent Context

If you see repeated unexpected searches, update the agent's required files:

**Before** (in `generator.py`):
```python
AgentType.CODE_DEVELOPER: [
    "docs/roadmap/ROADMAP.md",
    ".claude/CLAUDE.md",
    ".claude/agents/code_developer.md",
]
```

**After** (add frequently searched file):
```python
AgentType.CODE_DEVELOPER: [
    "docs/roadmap/ROADMAP.md",
    ".claude/CLAUDE.md",
    ".claude/agents/code_developer.md",
    "tests/conftest.py",  # ‚Üê Added based on search logs
]
```

---

## 8. Real-World Scenarios

### Scenario A: Debugging Ownership Violations

**Problem**: `assistant` keeps trying to write code, causing delegations.

**Solution**:

```python
from coffee_maker.autonomous.ace.generator import get_generator
from coffee_maker.autonomous.agent_registry import AgentType

generator = get_generator()

# Get all delegations from assistant
traces = generator.get_delegation_traces(agent=AgentType.ASSISTANT)

# Find patterns
violation_counts = {}
for trace in traces:
    key = f"{trace.file_path} ({trace.operation.value})"
    violation_counts[key] = violation_counts.get(key, 0) + 1

# Print most common violations
print("Top violations by assistant:")
for file_op, count in sorted(violation_counts.items(), key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=True)[:5]:
    print(f"  {count}x: {file_op}")
```

**Output:**
```
Top violations by assistant:
  12x: coffee_maker/cli/helper.py (write)
  8x: tests/test_helper.py (write)
  5x: .claude/agents/assistant.md (edit)
```

**Action**: Update `assistant` agent definition to clarify it should NOT write code directly.

---

### Scenario B: Monitoring Agent Context Efficiency

**Problem**: Want to know if agents are using provided context or searching unnecessarily.

**Solution**:

```python
generator = get_generator()

# Run a task simulation
# ... (agents perform work) ...

# Get search statistics
stats = generator.get_search_stats()

print(f"Context Efficiency Report:")
print(f"  Total file searches: {stats['total_searches']}")
print(f"  Unexpected searches: {stats['unexpected_searches']}")
print(f"  Efficiency: {100 * (1 - stats['unexpected_searches']/max(stats['total_searches'], 1)):.1f}%")

print(f"\nMost searched patterns:")
for pattern_info in stats['most_common_patterns'][:3]:
    print(f"  {pattern_info['count']}x: {pattern_info['pattern']}")
```

**Output:**
```
Context Efficiency Report:
  Total file searches: 25
  Unexpected searches: 3
  Efficiency: 88.0%

Most searched patterns:
  5x: glob:**/*.py
  3x: grep:TODO
  2x: glob:tests/**/*
```

---

### Scenario C: Implementing Cross-Agent Feature

**Problem**: Need to implement a feature that touches multiple agent boundaries (code + docs + specs).

**Workflow**:

```python
from coffee_maker.autonomous.ace.generator import Generator
from coffee_maker.autonomous.agent_registry import AgentType

generator = Generator()

# Step 1: code_developer writes implementation
code_result = generator.intercept_file_operation(
    agent_type=AgentType.CODE_DEVELOPER,
    file_path="coffee_maker/new_feature.py",
    operation="write",
    content="# New feature implementation"
)
print(f"Code: {code_result.success}, delegated={code_result.delegated}")

# Step 2: code_developer tries to update ROADMAP (delegated)
roadmap_result = generator.intercept_file_operation(
    agent_type=AgentType.CODE_DEVELOPER,
    file_path="docs/roadmap/ROADMAP.md",
    operation="edit",
    content="Status: Complete"
)
print(f"ROADMAP: delegated to {roadmap_result.delegated_to.value}")

# Step 3: architect creates technical spec
spec_result = generator.intercept_file_operation(
    agent_type=AgentType.ARCHITECT,
    file_path="docs/architecture/specs/SPEC-999.md",
    operation="write",
    content="# Technical Specification"
)
print(f"Spec: {spec_result.success}, delegated={spec_result.delegated}")

# View all traces for this feature
traces = generator.get_delegation_traces(hours=1)
print(f"\nTotal operations: {len(traces)}")
```

---

### Scenario D: Database Query for Observability

**Problem**: Need to analyze all Generator activity across all agents.

**Solution**:

```bash
# Connect to database
sqlite3 data/orchestrator.db

# Query delegation patterns
SELECT
    agent_type,
    delegated_to,
    COUNT(*) as delegation_count,
    AVG(duration_ms) as avg_duration_ms
FROM generator_traces
WHERE delegated = 1
  AND started_at > datetime('now', '-7 days')
GROUP BY agent_type, delegated_to
ORDER BY delegation_count DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

**Output:**
```
agent_type       delegated_to       delegation_count  avg_duration_ms
---------------  -----------------  ----------------  ---------------
assistant        code_developer     45                23.4
project_manager  code_developer     28                18.7
code_developer   project_manager    15                12.3
assistant        architect          8                 31.2
```

---

### Scenario E: Automated Trace Cleanup

**Problem**: Database getting large with old traces.

**Solution**:

```python
import sqlite3
from datetime import datetime, timedelta
from pathlib import Path

db_path = Path("data/orchestrator.db")

# Delete traces older than 30 days
cutoff = (datetime.now() - timedelta(days=30)).isoformat()

with sqlite3.connect(str(db_path)) as conn:
    cursor = conn.cursor()

    # Count before
    cursor.execute("SELECT COUNT(*) FROM generator_traces WHERE started_at < ?", (cutoff,))
    count_before = cursor.fetchone()[0]

    # Delete
    cursor.execute("DELETE FROM generator_traces WHERE started_at < ?", (cutoff,))
    conn.commit()

    print(f"Deleted {count_before} old traces (>30 days)")

    # Vacuum to reclaim space
    cursor.execute("VACUUM")
    conn.commit()

    print("Database optimized")
```

---

## 9. Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Issue 1: Generator Not Intercepting Operations

**Symptoms**:
```python
result = generator.intercept_file_operation(...)
# result shows no delegation even though ownership violated
```

**Solution**:

```python
# Check FileOwnership registry
from coffee_maker.autonomous.ace.file_ownership import FileOwnership

try:
    owner = FileOwnership.get_owner("your/file/path.py")
    print(f"Owner: {owner.value}")
except Exception as e:
    print(f"Ownership unclear: {e}")
    # File ownership not defined - Generator fails open (allows operation)
```

**Fix**: Add file pattern to `FileOwnership` class in `coffee_maker/autonomous/ace/file_ownership.py`.

---

### Issue 2: Database Logging Not Working

**Symptoms**:
```
WARNING: Database not found at data/orchestrator.db, database logging disabled
```

**Solution**:

```bash
# Run migration to create generator_traces table
python coffee_maker/orchestrator/migrate_add_generator_traces.py

# Verify table exists
sqlite3 data/orchestrator.db "SELECT name FROM sqlite_master WHERE type='table' AND name='generator_traces';"
```

**Expected Output:**
```
generator_traces
```

---

### Issue 3: Traces Not Appearing

**Symptoms**: `get_delegation_traces()` returns empty list even though delegations occurred.

**Solution**:

```python
# Check if traces are in database but not in-memory
import sqlite3

with sqlite3.connect("data/orchestrator.db") as conn:
    cursor = conn.cursor()
    cursor.execute("SELECT COUNT(*) FROM generator_traces WHERE delegated = 1")
    db_count = cursor.fetchone()[0]
    print(f"Traces in database: {db_count}")

# In-memory traces are session-only
# Use database queries for historical analysis
```

---

### Issue 4: Too Many Delegations

**Symptoms**: High delegation count indicating agents don't understand their boundaries.

**Solution**:

```python
# Analyze delegation patterns
stats = generator.get_delegation_stats()
print("Most common violations:")
for violation in stats['most_common_violations']:
    print(f"  {violation['pattern']}: {violation['count']} times")

# Update agent definitions to clarify ownership
# Add to agent prompt: "You do NOT own files in X directory"
```

---

### Issue 5: OwnershipUnclearError

**Symptoms**:
```python
OwnershipUnclearError: Multiple potential owners for path: shared_file.py
```

**Solution**:

```python
# Check ownership registry
from coffee_maker.autonomous.ace.file_ownership import FileOwnership

# Option 1: Make ownership explicit in FileOwnership class
# Add pattern to specific agent's ownership

# Option 2: Fail open (Generator allows operation with warning)
# No action needed - Generator logs warning and allows
```

---

## 10. FAQ

### Q1: Does every file operation go through Generator?

**A:** Not automatically. The Generator provides `intercept_file_operation()` method that should be called by agent wrapper code. Currently implemented for demonstration - full integration planned.

### Q2: How do I view all Generator traces?

**A:** Two ways:

```python
# In-memory (current session)
generator = get_generator()
traces = generator.get_delegation_traces()

# Database (persistent, historical)
import sqlite3
with sqlite3.connect("data/orchestrator.db") as conn:
    cursor = conn.cursor()
    cursor.execute("SELECT * FROM generator_traces ORDER BY started_at DESC LIMIT 100")
    rows = cursor.fetchall()
```

### Q3: Can I manually trigger a delegation?

**A:** Yes, call `intercept_file_operation()` directly:

```python
result = generator.intercept_file_operation(
    agent_type=AgentType.ASSISTANT,
    file_path="coffee_maker/code.py",
    operation="write",
    content="# Code"
)
```

### Q4: How do I delete bad traces?

**A:** Traces are append-only for audit purposes. To clean up old data:

```python
# Clear in-memory traces (testing only)
generator.clear_traces()

# Delete from database (be careful!)
import sqlite3
with sqlite3.connect("data/orchestrator.db") as conn:
    cursor = conn.cursor()
    cursor.execute("DELETE FROM generator_traces WHERE trace_id = ?", (trace_id,))
    conn.commit()
```

### Q5: How do delegation traces improve the system?

**A:** By analyzing traces, you can:
- Identify agents that frequently violate ownership
- Find files with unclear ownership
- Optimize agent definitions
- Improve context-upfront file lists
- Detect architectural issues early

### Q6: Can multiple agents share ownership of a file?

**A:** Currently no. Each file has one owner. If ownership is unclear, `FileOwnership.get_owner()` raises `OwnershipUnclearError` and Generator fails open (allows operation).

### Q7: How do I backup/restore traces?

**A:** Traces are in SQLite database:

```bash
# Backup
cp data/orchestrator.db data/orchestrator.db.backup

# Restore
cp data/orchestrator.db.backup data/orchestrator.db

# Export to JSON
sqlite3 data/orchestrator.db <<EOF
.mode json
.output traces_backup.json
SELECT * FROM generator_traces;
.quit
EOF
```

### Q8: What's the storage footprint?

**A:** Approximately:
- 500 bytes per delegation trace (in-memory)
- 1 KB per trace record (database with indexes)
- For 10,000 traces: ~10 MB

Cleanup old traces periodically (see Scenario E).

### Q9: How do I integrate Generator with my agent?

**A:** Wrap file operations:

```python
from coffee_maker.autonomous.ace.generator import get_generator
from coffee_maker.autonomous.agent_registry import AgentType

class MyAgent:
    def __init__(self):
        self.generator = get_generator()
        self.agent_type = AgentType.MY_AGENT

    def write_file(self, path, content):
        result = self.generator.intercept_file_operation(
            agent_type=self.agent_type,
            file_path=path,
            operation="write",
            content=content
        )

        if result.delegated:
            # Operation delegated to owner
            print(f"Delegated to {result.delegated_to.value}")
        else:
            # Perform actual write
            Path(path).write_text(content)
```

### Q10: Can I use ACE with other AI providers?

**A:** Yes! The ACE Generator is provider-agnostic. It works with any agent system that performs file operations.

## 11. Advanced Tips & Tricks

### Tip 1: Query Delegation Patterns

```python
# Find which agents delegate most to code_developer
stats = generator.get_delegation_stats()
for agent, count in stats['delegations_by_requesting_agent'].items():
    if agent in ['assistant', 'project_manager']:
        print(f"{agent} delegated {count} times - consider updating agent definition")
```

### Tip 2: Monitor Real-Time Delegations

```python
import time

last_count = 0
while True:
    stats = generator.get_delegation_stats()
    new_count = stats['total_delegations']

    if new_count > last_count:
        print(f"[{time.strftime('%H:%M:%S')}] New delegation detected! Total: {new_count}")
        # Get latest trace
        recent = generator.get_delegation_traces(hours=1)
        latest = recent[-1]
        print(f"  {latest.requesting_agent.value} ‚Üí {latest.owner_agent.value}: {latest.file_path}")

    last_count = new_count
    time.sleep(5)
```

### Tip 3: Export Delegation Report

```python
import json
from datetime import datetime

def export_delegation_report(hours=24):
    generator = get_generator()
    traces = generator.get_delegation_traces(hours=hours)

    report = {
        "generated_at": datetime.now().isoformat(),
        "time_window_hours": hours,
        "total_delegations": len(traces),
        "traces": [trace.to_dict() for trace in traces]
    }

    report_path = f"delegation_report_{datetime.now().strftime('%Y%m%d_%H%M%S')}.json"
    with open(report_path, 'w') as f:
        json.dump(report, f, indent=2)

    print(f"Report exported: {report_path}")

export_delegation_report(hours=168)  # Last 7 days
```

### Tip 4: Context Optimization

```python
# Find which files are frequently read but not in context
def analyze_missing_context():
    stats = generator.get_search_stats()

    # Extract searched file patterns
    patterns = [p['pattern'] for p in stats['most_common_patterns']]

    print("Consider adding these to agent context:")
    for pattern in patterns:
        if "glob:" in pattern or "grep:" in pattern:
            print(f"  - {pattern}")

analyze_missing_context()
```

### Tip 5: Automated Delegation Alerts

```python
import smtplib
from email.message import EmailMessage

def check_delegation_threshold(max_delegations=50):
    stats = generator.get_delegation_stats()

    if stats['total_delegations'] > max_delegations:
        # Send alert
        msg = EmailMessage()
        msg['Subject'] = '‚ö†Ô∏è High Delegation Count Alert'
        msg['From'] = 'generator@example.com'
        msg['To'] = 'admin@example.com'
        msg.set_content(f"Delegation count exceeded threshold: {stats['total_delegations']}")

        # Send email (configure SMTP)
        # smtp.send_message(msg)

        print(f"Alert: {stats['total_delegations']} delegations detected!")

# Run periodically
check_delegation_threshold()
```

### Tip 6: Database Performance Optimization

```sql
-- Add indexes for faster queries
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_generator_traces_agent ON generator_traces(agent_type);
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_generator_traces_delegated ON generator_traces(delegated);
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_generator_traces_time ON generator_traces(started_at);

-- Query with index
SELECT agent_type, COUNT(*)
FROM generator_traces
WHERE delegated = 1 AND started_at > datetime('now', '-7 days')
GROUP BY agent_type;
```

### Tip 7: Integration with Observability Tools

```python
# Export to Langfuse (observability platform used in this project)
from langfuse import Langfuse

langfuse = Langfuse()

def log_delegation_to_langfuse(trace):
    langfuse.trace(
        name="file_operation_delegation",
        input={
            "requesting_agent": trace.requesting_agent.value,
            "file_path": trace.file_path,
            "operation": trace.operation.value
        },
        output={
            "delegated_to": trace.owner_agent.value,
            "success": trace.success
        },
        metadata={
            "trace_id": trace.trace_id,
            "reason": trace.reason
        }
    )

# Use after each delegation
for trace in generator.get_delegation_traces(hours=1):
    log_delegation_to_langfuse(trace)
```
