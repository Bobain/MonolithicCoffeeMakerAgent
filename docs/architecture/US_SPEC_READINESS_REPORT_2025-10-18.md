- Novel patterns: Yes (first multi-agent daemon)
- POC exists: Yes (validates architecture)

**Assessment**: **READY FOR IMPLEMENTATION** ‚úÖ
- Spec is comprehensive (100+ lines with architecture diagrams)
- POC validates approach (TeamDaemon, AgentProcess, MessageQueue)
- code_developer can implement immediately

## Immediate Actions Required

### 1. Create SPEC-054: Architect assistant (with code analysis skills) Daily Integration (HIGH PRIORITY)

**Estimated Time**: 2-3 hours
**Why**: PRIORITY 15 is blocked without spec
**Deliverable**: `docs/architecture/specs/SPEC-054-architect-assistant (with code analysis skills)-daily-integration.md`

**Spec Should Include**:
- Daily integration workflow (check for reports ‚Üí read ‚Üí extract actions)
- Weekly codebase analysis (scan code ‚Üí identify issues ‚Üí document)
- Enforcement mechanism (CFR-011 validation before spec creation)
- Tracking data structure (`architect_integration_status.json`)
- CLI commands (`architect daily-integration`, `architect analyze-codebase`)
- Integration with spec creation (blocking logic)

### 2. Create SPEC-050: POC Creation Framework (HIGH PRIORITY)

**Estimated Time**: 2-3 hours
**Why**: PRIORITY 16 is blocked without spec
**Deliverable**: `docs/architecture/specs/SPEC-050-architect-poc-creation-framework.md`

**Spec Should Include**:
- POC criteria (when to create: effort > 2 days + complexity = high)
- Decision matrix (effort + complexity ‚Üí POC or no POC)

- Integration with architect workflow
- Examples (reference POC-072 as model)

### 3. Create SPEC-055: Claude Skills Phase 1 (CRITICAL PRIORITY)

**Estimated Time**: 8-12 hours (LARGE spec)
**Why**: PRIORITY 17 is massive (84-104 hours) and high-risk
**Deliverable**: `docs/architecture/specs/SPEC-055-claude-skills-integration-phase-1.md`

**Spec Should Include**:
- Architecture overview (components, interactions)
- Component specifications:
  - ExecutionController (unified skill/prompt API)
  - SkillLoader (load skills from .claude/skills/)
  - SkillRegistry (automatic discovery)
  - SkillInvoker (secure execution, sandboxing)
  - AgentSkillController (per-agent orchestration)

**ALSO CREATE POC-055**:
- Validate Code Execution Tool integration
- Prove SkillLoader design works
- Test security sandboxing
- Estimated POC time: 4-6 hours

### 4. Defer US-056 and US-057 (NO ACTION YET)

**Why**: These depend on US-055 completion

2. ‚úÖ **SPEC-050** (2-3 hours) - Unblocks PRIORITY 16
3. ‚úÖ **SPEC-055 + POC-055** (12-18 hours total) - Unblocks PRIORITY 17

**Total Time**: 16-24 hours to unblock PRIORITY 15, 16, 17

### Implementation Sequence

**Week 1** (After specs created):
- Implement US-072 (Orchestrator) - 15-20 hours
- Implement US-047 (Architect-Only Spec) - 16-24 hours

**Week 2-3**:
- Implement US-054 (assistant (with code analysis skills) Integration) - 8-16 hours
- Implement US-050 (POC Framework) - 8-16 hours
- Start US-055 Phase 1 (Skills Infrastructure) - 84-104 hours (4 weeks)

**Week 4-7**:

- Create SPEC-056 (Phase 2) after US-055 done
- Create SPEC-057 (Phase 3) after US-056 done

### Quality Assurance

**Before Creating Each Spec**:

- [ ] ‚úÖ Read `.claude/CLAUDE.md` (existing architecture)
- [ ] ‚úÖ Read `docs/architecture/REUSABLE_COMPONENTS.md` (if exists)
- [ ] ‚úÖ Evaluate existing components (0-100% fitness)
- [ ] ‚úÖ Document reuse analysis in spec
- [ ] ‚úÖ If NEW component: Justify why existing insufficient

**Spec Quality Checklist**:
- [ ] Problem statement clear (what are we solving?)
- [ ] Architecture overview included (high-level design)
- [ ] Component specifications detailed (classes, modules, APIs)
- [ ] Data flow diagrams present (how data moves)
- [ ] Implementation plan phased (step-by-step breakdown)
- [ ] Testing strategy comprehensive (unit, integration, E2E)
- [ ] Security considerations addressed (if applicable)
- [ ] Performance requirements specified (if applicable)
- [ ] Risk analysis included (what could go wrong)
- [ ] Success criteria clear (how do we know it works?)

1. **Immediate** (Next 2-3 days):
   - Create SPEC-054 (2-3 hours)
   - Create SPEC-050 (2-3 hours)
   - Create SPEC-055 + POC-055 (12-18 hours)

2. **After Specs Created**:
   - code_developer can implement US-047, US-048, US-049, US-072 immediately
   - code_developer can implement US-054, US-050 after specs ready
   - US-055 requires POC validation before full implementation

3. **Future Specs** (Defer):
   - SPEC-056 after US-055 complete
   - SPEC-057 after US-056 complete

**Total Spec Creation Effort**: 16-24 hours to unblock critical path

**architect should start with SPEC-054, then SPEC-050, then SPEC-055 (most complex).**
