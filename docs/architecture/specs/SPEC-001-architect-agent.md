# SPEC-001: architect Agent for Technical Specifications and Dependency Management

**Status**: Implemented

**Author**: architect agent

**Date Created**: 2025-10-16

**Last Updated**: 2025-10-16

**Related**: [US-034 in ROADMAP.md](../../ROADMAP.md#us-034-create-architect-agent)

**Related ADRs**: None (this is the first architectural agent)

**Assigned To**: code_developer

---

## Executive Summary

This specification describes the technical design for the **architect agent**, a new autonomous agent that serves as the technical design authority for the MonolithicCoffeeMakerAgent project. The architect agent creates technical specifications before implementation, documents architectural decisions in ADRs, manages dependencies with user approval, and ensures architectural consistency across the codebase.

---

## Problem Statement

### Current Situation

Currently, the development workflow goes directly from strategic planning (project_manager) to implementation (code_developer):

```
Strategic Planning (project_manager)
         ↓
Implementation (code_developer)
         ↓
Verification (project_manager)
```

This creates several problems:

1. **No technical design phase**: code_developer implements features without detailed technical specifications
2. **Undocumented architectural decisions**: Why certain patterns were chosen is lost to time
3. **Uncontrolled dependency management**: Any agent can modify `pyproject.toml`, leading to dependency bloat
4. **Architectural drift**: No consistency checking before implementation
5. **Missing implementation guidelines**: code_developer lacks clear patterns to follow

**Example issues**:
- code_developer added dependencies without security review
- Architectural patterns (like mixins) were used but never documented
- No historical record of why technical decisions were made
- Inconsistent code patterns across the codebase

### Goal

Establish a technical design authority that:

1. **Creates technical specifications** before code_developer implements complex features
2. **Documents architectural decisions** in ADRs for future reference
3. **Manages dependencies safely** with user approval and security review
4. **Provides implementation guidelines** for code_developer to follow
5. **Ensures architectural consistency** across the codebase

**Success Criteria**:
- Complex features (>1 day) have technical specs before implementation
- All significant architectural decisions are documented in ADRs
- ALL dependency changes require user approval (enforced by architect agent)
- code_developer follows implementation guidelines
- Codebase has consistent architectural patterns

### Non-Goals

- NOT building code (that's code_developer's job)
- NOT creating strategic specifications (that's project_manager's job)
- NOT managing ROADMAP priorities (that's project_manager's job)
- NOT implementing features (that's code_developer's job)

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

1. **FR-1**: Create technical specifications in `docs/architecture/specs/`
   - Detailed implementation plans with architecture diagrams
   - API designs, data structures, algorithms
   - Testing strategies, rollout plans

2. **FR-2**: Document architectural decisions in `docs/architecture/decisions/`
   - ADRs following standard format (Context, Decision, Consequences)
   - Track status (Proposed, Accepted, Deprecated, Superseded)
   - Capture alternatives considered and why rejected

3. **FR-3**: Manage dependencies with user approval
   - ONLY agent allowed to modify `pyproject.toml`
   - Evaluate dependencies (security, licensing, maintenance)
   - Request user approval before adding packages
   - Document dependency decisions in ADRs

4. **FR-4**: Provide implementation guidelines in `docs/architecture/guidelines/`
   - Code patterns and best practices
   - When to use, how to implement, anti-patterns to avoid

5. **FR-5**: Interact with other agents
   - Receive requests via user_listener (user interface)
   - Provide specs to code_developer (implementation)
   - Coordinate with project_manager (strategic alignment)

### Non-Functional Requirements

1. **NFR-1**: Specs must be clear and actionable
   - code_developer can implement without confusion
   - Include all necessary technical details
   - Provide diagrams and examples

2. **NFR-2**: ADRs must capture context
   - Future developers understand WHY decisions were made
   - Document alternatives considered
   - Track decision lifecycle (proposed → accepted → deprecated)

3. **NFR-3**: Dependency approval must be secure
   - Check for known vulnerabilities (CVEs)
   - Verify license compatibility
   - Assess maintenance status (last update, active maintainers)
   - Evaluate package size impact

4. **NFR-4**: Guidelines must be practical
   - Include code examples (good vs bad)
   - Cover edge cases and common pitfalls
   - Provide testing strategies

5. **NFR-5**: Maintain observability
   - All architect activities tracked in Langfuse
   - Audit trail for dependency decisions
   - Metrics on specs created, ADRs documented

### Constraints

- Must work through user_listener (cannot interact with user directly)
- Must not modify code_developer's owned files (coffee_maker/, tests/)
- Must not modify project_manager's owned files (docs/roadmap/)
- ONLY agent allowed to modify pyproject.toml (critical security boundary)
- Must maintain backward compatibility with existing workflows

---

## Proposed Solution

### High-Level Approach

Create a new **architect agent** that operates between project_manager and code_developer:

```
Strategic Planning (project_manager)
         ↓
Technical Design (architect) ← NEW
         ↓
Implementation (code_developer)
         ↓
Verification (project_manager)
```

**architect's responsibilities**:
1. Receives design requests from user (via user_listener)
2. Creates technical specifications with detailed implementation plans
3. Documents architectural decisions in ADRs
4. Evaluates and approves dependencies (ONLY agent with this power)
5. Provides implementation guidelines for code_developer
6. Returns completed specs to user (via user_listener)

                   │  [Creates ADRs, specs, guidelines]
                   │  [Manages pyproject.toml]
                   │        │
                   │        v
                   └──> ┌─────────────────┐
                        │ code_developer  │ (Implementation)
                        └─────────────────┘

Workflow:
1. User requests feature via user_listener
2. project_manager creates user story (strategic)
3. architect creates technical spec (design)
4. code_developer implements (code)
5. project_manager verifies (quality)
```

- **Document Storage**: `docs/architecture/` (git-tracked markdown files)
- **Templates**: ADR, technical spec, implementation guideline templates
- **Integration**: Claude CLI agent system (same as other agents)
- **Observability**: Langfuse tracking for all architect activities

## Detailed Design

### Component 1: Agent Definition File

**Responsibility**: Define architect agent's role, responsibilities, and workflow

**Location**: `.claude/agents/architect.md`

**Interface**:
```markdown
---
name: architect
description: Technical design authority that creates architectural specifications...
model: sonnet
color: purple
---

# architect Agent

**Role**: Technical Design Authority

(Full agent instructions)
```

**Implementation Notes**:
- Based on existing agent templates (code_developer.md, project_manager.md)
- Includes comprehensive workflow examples
- Documents interaction with other agents
- Specifies document ownership boundaries

### Component 2: Directory Structure

**Responsibility**: Organize architectural documentation

**Structure**:
```
docs/architecture/
├── decisions/          # ADRs (Architectural Decision Records)
│   ├── ADR-000-template.md
│   ├── ADR-001-use-mixins-pattern.md
│   └── ...
├── specs/              # Technical specifications
│   ├── SPEC-000-template.md
│   ├── SPEC-001-architect-agent.md
│   └── ...
└── guidelines/         # Implementation guidelines
    ├── GUIDELINE-000-template.md
    ├── GUIDELINE-001-error-handling.md
    └── ...
```

**Implementation Notes**:
- Clear separation between decisions, specs, and guidelines
- Templates provide consistent structure
- Numbered for easy reference (ADR-001, SPEC-002, etc.)

### Component 3: ADR Template

**Responsibility**: Standard format for documenting architectural decisions

**Location**: `docs/architecture/decisions/ADR-000-template.md`

**Structure**:
```markdown
# ADR-XXX: [Title]
**Status**: Proposed | Accepted | Deprecated | Superseded
**Date**: YYYY-MM-DD

## Context
What's the situation and problem?

## Decision
What did we decide?

## Consequences
What are the trade-offs?

## Alternatives Considered
What else did we consider and why reject it?
```

**Implementation Notes**:
- Based on industry-standard ADR format
- Captures WHY decisions were made, not just WHAT
- Tracks decision lifecycle (proposed → accepted → deprecated)

### Component 4: Technical Spec Template

**Responsibility**: Standard format for detailed implementation specifications

**Location**: `docs/architecture/specs/SPEC-000-template.md`

**Structure**:
```markdown
# SPEC-XXX: [Feature Name]
**Status**: Draft | In Review | Approved | Implemented

## Problem Statement
What problem are we solving?

## Proposed Solution
High-level approach, architecture diagrams

## Detailed Design
Components, data structures, APIs, algorithms

## Testing Strategy
Unit tests, integration tests, performance tests

## Rollout Plan
Phased deployment approach

## Risks & Mitigations
What could go wrong and how to handle it
```

**Implementation Notes**:
- Comprehensive enough for code_developer to implement
- Includes architecture diagrams (ASCII art)
- Specifies testing requirements
- Identifies risks and mitigations

### Component 5: Implementation Guideline Template

**Responsibility**: Standard format for code patterns and best practices

**Location**: `docs/architecture/guidelines/GUIDELINE-000-template.md`

**Structure**:
```markdown
# GUIDELINE-XXX: [Title]
**Category**: Design Pattern | Best Practice | Anti-Pattern

## When to Use
When should this pattern be used?

## Implementation
Step-by-step with code examples

## Testing
How to test code using this pattern

## Common Pitfalls
What mistakes to avoid

## Anti-Patterns
What NOT to do (with examples)
```

**Implementation Notes**:
- Practical and actionable
- Includes good vs bad code examples
- Covers edge cases and pitfalls
- Provides testing strategies

### Component 6: Dependency Management Workflow

**Responsibility**: Safe dependency approval process

**Process Flow**:
```
code_developer needs dependency (e.g., redis)
         ↓
code_developer delegates to architect (cannot modify pyproject.toml)
         ↓
architect evaluates dependency:
  - Security: Check for CVEs
  - Licensing: Verify compatibility
  - Maintenance: Last update, active maintainers?
  - Size: Impact on install size?
  - Alternatives: Better options?
         ↓
architect creates proposal with justification
         ↓
architect requests user approval via user_listener
         ↓
user_listener presents to user: [y/n]
         ↓
User approves/denies via user_listener
         ↓
If approved:
  - architect runs: poetry add <package>
  - architect creates ADR documenting decision
  - architect notifies code_developer: "package added"
If denied:
  - architect notifies code_developer: "denied, reason: X"
  - architect suggests alternatives
```

**Safety Checks**:
- CVE database lookup for security vulnerabilities
- License compatibility check (GPL? MIT? Apache?)
- Maintenance status (last commit, active maintainers)
- Package size impact (install size, transitive dependencies)
- Alternatives analysis (are there better options?)

**Implementation Notes**:
- User approval REQUIRED for all dependency additions
- Architect logs all dependency evaluations
- ADR created for every dependency decision
- Audit trail for compliance

---

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests

**Test Files**: `tests/unit/test_architect_agent.py`

**Test Cases**:
1. `test_create_adr()` - ADR is created with correct format
2. `test_create_technical_spec()` - Spec is created with required sections
3. `test_create_guideline()` - Guideline is created with code examples
4. `test_evaluate_dependency()` - Dependency evaluation logic
5. `test_security_check()` - CVE checking works
6. `test_license_check()` - License compatibility validation
7. `test_dependency_approval_required()` - Cannot add without approval
8. `test_document_ownership()` - Cannot modify non-owned files

### Integration Tests

**Test Files**: `tests/integration/test_architect_integration.py`

**Test Cases**:
1. `test_architect_via_user_listener()` - End-to-end request workflow
2. `test_dependency_approval_workflow()` - Full dependency addition flow
3. `test_spec_to_implementation()` - architect spec → code_developer implements
4. `test_adr_lifecycle()` - Proposed → Accepted → Deprecated

### Manual Testing

**Scenarios**:
1. User requests architectural design via user_listener
2. architect creates technical spec
3. User reviews and approves spec
4. code_developer implements based on spec
5. Verify spec was accurate and complete

**Dependency Addition**:
1. code_developer needs new package
2. code_developer requests from architect
3. architect evaluates and requests approval
4. User approves via user_listener
5. architect adds dependency and creates ADR
6. Verify pyproject.toml updated, ADR exists

## Risks & Mitigations

### Risk 1: Architect Becomes Bottleneck

**Description**: Every complex feature requires architect involvement, slowing development

**Likelihood**: Medium

**Impact**: High

**Mitigation**:
- Architect only required for complex features (>1 day implementation)
- Simple features can skip technical spec
- code_developer can proceed with guidelines for common patterns
- Parallel work: architect designs next feature while code_developer implements current

### Risk 2: Dependency Approval Delays

**Description**: Waiting for user approval for dependencies slows implementation

**Likelihood**: Medium

**Impact**: Medium

**Mitigation**:
- architect evaluates dependencies quickly (same day)
- User can approve asynchronously via user_listener
- Common dependencies pre-approved (documented in guidelines)
- code_developer can continue other work while waiting

### Risk 3: Documentation Overhead

**Description**: Creating ADRs and specs for everything is too much work

**Likelihood**: Low

**Impact**: Medium

**Mitigation**:
- ADRs only for significant decisions (not every small change)
- Technical specs only for complex features (>1 day)
- Templates make creation faster (copy and fill in)
- Documentation pays off over time (fewer repeated mistakes)

### Risk 4: Unclear Ownership Boundaries

**Description**: Confusion about what architect owns vs other agents

**Likelihood**: Low

**Impact**: High

**Mitigation**:
- Clear ownership matrix in `DOCUMENT_OWNERSHIP_MATRIX.md`
- Agent definitions specify boundaries
- Code reviews enforce boundaries
- Automated checks can detect ownership violations

---

## Observability

### Metrics

Track architect agent activities:

- `architect.specs_created` (counter) - Number of technical specs created
- `architect.adrs_created` (counter) - Number of ADRs documented
- `architect.dependencies_evaluated` (counter) - Dependencies evaluated
- `architect.dependencies_approved` (counter) - Dependencies approved by user
- `architect.dependencies_denied` (counter) - Dependencies denied
- `architect.guidelines_created` (counter) - Implementation guidelines created
- `architect.spec_implementation_time` (histogram) - Time from spec to implementation

### Logs

Log all architect activities:

- INFO: Spec created (spec_id, feature_name)
- INFO: ADR created (adr_id, decision_title)
- INFO: Dependency evaluated (package_name, result)
- INFO: User approval requested (package_name)
- INFO: User approved dependency (package_name)
- WARNING: User denied dependency (package_name, reason)
- ERROR: Dependency evaluation failed (package_name, error)

### Alerts

Set up alerts for:

- Dependency approval pending > 24 hours (may be blocking code_developer)
- ADRs not created for major decisions (architectural drift risk)
- Technical specs missing for complex features (implementation risk)

---

## Documentation

### User Documentation

**Updates Needed**:
- Add architect to agent list in README.md
- Document how to request architectural designs
- Explain dependency approval workflow
- Add examples of when to use architect

### Developer Documentation

**Updates Needed**:
- Update CLAUDE.md with architect information
- Update DOCUMENT_OWNERSHIP_MATRIX.md with architect ownership
- Update agent interaction diagrams
- Document architectural workflow (strategic → technical → implementation)

---

## Security Considerations

1. **Dependency Security**: architect checks CVEs before approving dependencies
2. **Access Control**: ONLY architect can modify pyproject.toml (enforced by file ownership)
3. **Audit Trail**: All dependency decisions logged and documented in ADRs
4. **License Compliance**: architect verifies license compatibility
5. **Supply Chain Security**: architect evaluates package maintenance status

---

## Cost Estimate

**Infrastructure**: $0 (no new infrastructure needed)

**Development**:
- Phase 1: Agent definition & templates (8 hours) ✅
- Phase 2: Example documents (4 hours) ✅
- Phase 3: Integration & documentation (4 hours) - In Progress
- Phase 4: Testing & validation (4 hours) - Pending
**Total**: 20 hours (~2.5 days)

**Ongoing**:
- Creating specs: 2-4 hours per complex feature
- Creating ADRs: 30 minutes per decision
- Evaluating dependencies: 15 minutes per package
- Maintaining guidelines: 1 hour per month

---

## Future Enhancements

**Phase 2+ Enhancements**:
1. **Automated dependency scanning**: Integrate with Dependabot or Snyk
2. **Architecture diagrams**: Generate diagrams from code (PlantUML, Graphviz)
3. **Spec templates**: Create templates for common feature types
4. **ADR search**: Searchable ADR index for quick reference
5. **Architecture linting**: Detect architectural violations automatically
6. **Spec validation**: Validate specs have all required sections before approval

**Note**: This specification is self-documenting - it describes the architect agent while simultaneously being created by that agent. This is a "chicken and egg" bootstrapping scenario where the architect agent defines itself. Future specs will be created before implementation, but this one is created during implementation as an example.
