# Architect Skills System - Summary

**Date**: 2025-10-18
**Purpose**: Ensure architect NEVER proposes new components without checking existing architecture
**Impact**: Prevents technical debt, ensures architectural consistency, saves implementation time

---

## 🎯 Problem Solved

**Before Skills (2025-10-18 incident)**:
```
User: "architect doit relire commits du code_developer"
       ↓
architect (without checking existing architecture):
       ↓
Proposed: Git hooks (external trigger)
       ❌ Did NOT check orchestrator messaging (existing component)
       ❌ Proposed external dependency instead of reusing native system
       ❌ Would add complexity + lose observability
```

**After Skills (with architecture-reuse-check)**:
```
User: "architect doit relire commits du code_developer"
       ↓
architect (MANDATORY skill execution):
       ↓
Runs: architecture-reuse-check skill
       ↓
Finds: Orchestrator messaging (existing component)
       ↓
Evaluates: Fitness 100% (perfect match)
       ↓
Proposes: REUSE orchestrator messaging
       ✅ Uses existing native system
       ✅ Maintains observability
       ✅ Saves 3 hours + simpler architecture
```

## 📚 Skills Created

### 1. architecture-reuse-check (MANDATORY - Before Every Spec)

**Location**: `.claude/skills/architecture-reuse-check.md`

**When**: **MANDATORY before creating ANY technical specification**

**Purpose**: Prevent proposing new components when existing ones can be reused

**Process**:
1. Identify problem domain (inter-agent communication / config / file I/O / etc.)
2. Check existing components (from `REUSABLE_COMPONENTS.md`)
3. Evaluate fitness (0-100%)
4. Decide: REUSE (>90%) / EXTEND (70-89%) / ADAPT (50-69%) / NEW (<50%)
5. Document reuse analysis in spec

**Checks 12 Architectural Domains**:
- Inter-agent communication (orchestrator messaging)
- Agent orchestration (OrchestratorAgent)
- Singleton enforcement (AgentRegistry)
- Configuration (ConfigManager)
- File I/O (atomic utilities)
- Observability (Langfuse)
- Prompt management (PromptLoader)
- Git operations (GitOperations mixin)
- GitHub integration (gh CLI wrapper)
- Notifications (NotificationSystem)
- Status tracking (Agent status files)
- Project planning (ROADMAP.md)

**Output Required in Spec**:
```markdown
## 🔍 Architecture Reuse Check

### Existing Components Evaluated
1. **Component Name** - Fitness: X% - Decision: REUSE/REJECT

### Final Decision
Chosen: Component X (fitness: Y%)
Benefits: ...
Trade-offs: ...
```

---

### 2. proactive-refactoring-analysis (Weekly Automatic)

**Location**: `.claude/skills/proactive-refactoring-analysis.md`

**When**: **Automatically every Monday 9:00 AM** + after major feature completion

**Purpose**: Identify refactoring opportunities BEFORE they become blocking

**Analyzes 7 Areas**:
1. Code duplication (>20% duplicated blocks)
2. File size & complexity (>500 LOC, cyclomatic >10)
3. Naming & clarity (vague names, magic numbers)
4. Architecture patterns (god classes, tight coupling)
5. Technical debt indicators (TODO, FIXME, HACK comments)
6. Test coverage (<80%)
7. Dependency management (unused, outdated, circular deps)

**Output**: **Synthetic report** (1-2 pages, NOT 20 pages!)
- Top 3 priorities by ROI (time saved / effort invested)
- Suggested ROADMAP entries (ready to copy-paste)
- Action plan (next steps for project_manager)

**Automatic Execution**:
```python
# ArchitectAgent._do_background_work()
if self._should_run_refactoring_analysis():  # Monday + >7 days
    self._run_refactoring_skill()  # Generates report, sends to project_manager
```

## 🔄 Workflow Changes

### Before (Without Skills)

```
User request → architect creates spec → spec may propose new component
                                        ❌ May miss existing components
                                        ❌ May add unnecessary complexity
                                        ❌ May violate architectural consistency
```

### After (With Skills)

```
User request → architect runs architecture-reuse-check skill
                         ↓
            Finds existing components + evaluates fitness
                         ↓
            Creates spec using EXISTING components (if >90% fit)
                         ↓
            ✅ Reuses native architecture
            ✅ Maintains consistency
            ✅ Saves implementation time
```

## 🎓 Lessons Learned (Git Hooks Incident)

### What Went Wrong (2025-10-18)

**Incident**: architect proposed git hooks for commit review without checking existing architecture

**Root Cause**:
- architect did NOT check for existing inter-agent communication mechanism
- Jumped directly to solution (git hooks)
- Missed orchestrator messaging (perfect fit, 100% fitness)

**Impact**:
- Would have added external dependency (git hooks)
- Would have bypassed orchestrator (lost observability)
- Would have wasted 3 hours implementing inferior solution

### How Skills Prevent This

**architecture-reuse-check skill**:
1. Identifies problem domain: "inter-agent communication"
2. Checks existing components: Finds "orchestrator messaging"
3. Evaluates fitness: 100% (perfect match)
4. Decision: REUSE orchestrator messaging (no git hooks!)

**Result**:
- ✅ Uses existing native system
- ✅ Maintains full observability
- ✅ Saves 3 hours + simpler architecture
- ✅ Prevents future maintenance burden

### Key Takeaway

> **"ALWAYS check existing architecture BEFORE proposing new solutions"**

This is now **MANDATORY** via skills - architect CANNOT skip this step.

## 🚀 Usage Examples

### Example 1: Creating Technical Spec (With Reuse Check)

**User Request**: "Add caching layer for API responses"

**architect Process**:
```markdown
1. Run architecture-reuse-check skill
   - Problem domain: "Data caching"
   - Existing components checked:
     * ConfigManager (NO - for config, not caching)
     * File I/O utilities (PARTIAL - could use for cache storage)
     * ROADMAP.md (NO - for planning, not caching)
   - No perfect fit found (all <50% fitness)

2. Evaluate alternatives
   - Option A: Use file I/O utils for cache storage (60% fit)
   - Option B: Add redis dependency (need architect approval)
   - Option C: Implement in-memory cache (simple, no deps)

3. Decision: Option C (in-memory cache) + file I/O for persistence
   - Fitness: 70% (extend existing file I/O)
   - No new dependencies needed
   - Reuses atomic write utilities

4. Create spec with reuse analysis
   ```

**Spec Output**:
```markdown
## 🔍 Architecture Reuse Check

### Existing Components Evaluated

1. **File I/O Utilities** (coffee_maker/utils/file_io.py)
   - Fitness: 70%
   - Decision: ✅ EXTEND (use for cache persistence)
   - Rationale: Atomic writes perfect for cache save/load

2. **Redis** (external dependency)
   - Fitness: 100% (feature-wise)
   - Decision: ❌ REJECT
   - Rationale: Overkill for current scale, adds external dependency

### Final Decision

**Chosen**: In-memory cache + file I/O persistence (70% reuse)

**Benefits**:
- ✅ Reuses existing file I/O utilities (atomic writes)
- ✅ No external dependencies
- ✅ Simple implementation (2-3 hours)

**Trade-offs**:
- ⚠️ In-memory only (not distributed)
- ✅ But: Acceptable for current scale (<1000 users)
```

### Example 2: Weekly Refactoring Analysis

**Trigger**: Monday 9:00 AM (automatic)

**architect Process**:
```
1. Check if Monday + >7 days since last analysis
   ✅ Monday + 8 days → Run skill

2. Execute proactive-refactoring-analysis skill
   - Analyze codebase (15,234 LOC)
   - Identify duplication (450 LOC, 3%)
   - Find large files (5 files >500 LOC)
   - Detect god classes (3 classes >15 methods)
   - Check test coverage (78% overall)
   - Count TODOs (12 comments)

3. Generate synthetic report (1-2 pages)
   - Top 3 priorities by ROI
   - Suggested ROADMAP entries
   - Action plan for project_manager

4. Send report to project_manager
   - Message type: "refactoring_analysis_report"
   - Priority: NORMAL
   - Content: report file + summary + top priorities

5. Update last run timestamp
   - File: data/architect_status/last_refactoring_analysis.json
   - Next run: 2025-10-25 (Monday in 7 days)
```

**Report Output**:
```markdown
# Refactoring Analysis Report

**Date**: 2025-10-18
**Opportunities Found**: 8
**Total Effort**: 32-40 hours
**Time Savings**: 60-80 hours (2x ROI)

## Top 3 Priorities (Highest ROI)

### 1. Extract ConfigManager (HIGHEST ROI)
**Effort**: 2-3 hours
**Savings**: 15+ hours (future)
**ROI**: 🟢 VERY HIGH (5x return)

[Suggested ROADMAP entry - ready to copy-paste]

### 2. Split daemon.py into Mixins
### 3. Add Orchestrator Tests

## Action Plan
1. project_manager: Review + add to ROADMAP
2. architect: Create specs for approved items
3. code_developer: Implement refactorings
```
