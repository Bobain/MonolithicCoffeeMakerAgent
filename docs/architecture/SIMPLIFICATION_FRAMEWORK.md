# Simplification Framework for architect

**Version**: 1.0
**Date**: 2025-10-16
**Owner**: architect agent
**Philosophy**: "Perfect code is when nothing else can be removed" - Antoine de Saint-Exupéry

---

## Executive Summary

This framework guides the architect in creating specifications that **minimize implementation complexity** and **maximize code reuse**. Every technical specification should be reviewed through the lens of simplification BEFORE being finalized.

**Core Mandate**: Make code_developer's implementation 30-50% easier by proactively eliminating complexity at the design stage.

---

## Simplification Principles

### 1. Delete > Add

**Philosophy**: The best code is no code.

**Questions to Ask**:
- Can this feature be eliminated entirely?
- Can we solve the problem with existing code?
- What's the simplest version that delivers value?
- Can we defer complexity to later phases?

**Example**:
```
❌ BAD: Implement full caching layer with Redis, TTL, pattern invalidation, statistics dashboard
✅ GOOD: Phase 1: In-memory dict cache. Phase 2: Add Redis if needed. Phase 3: Advanced features.
```

### 2. Reuse > Rebuild

**Philosophy**: Every line of new code is a liability.

**Questions to Ask**:
- What existing code does something similar?
- Can we extract a common pattern?
- What libraries/utilities already exist?
- Can we refactor existing code to be more general?

**Example**:
```
❌ BAD: Create new ValidationManager for user input
✅ GOOD: Extend existing coffee_maker/validation.py with user input validators
```

### 3. Abstract > Duplicate

**Philosophy**: Duplication is the root of all evil.

**Questions to Ask**:
- Where will code be duplicated?
- What pattern can eliminate duplication?
- Can we create a base class or mixin?
- What common utilities can be extracted?

**Example**:
```
❌ BAD: Each CLI command implements its own error handling
✅ GOOD: BaseCommand class with common error handling (see REFACTOR-001)
```

### 4. Simple > Clever

**Philosophy**: Code is read 10x more than written.

**Questions to Ask**:
- Would a junior developer understand this?
- Can we use a simpler algorithm?
- Do we really need this abstraction?
- What's the "boring" solution?

**Example**:
```
❌ BAD: Implement custom parser with complex regex and state machine
✅ GOOD: Use existing RoadmapParser class with simple string.find() for new fields
```

## Specification Review Checklist

**CRITICAL**: Apply this checklist to EVERY technical specification before finalizing.

### Phase 1: Complexity Analysis (5 minutes)

□ **Count components**: How many new classes/modules/files?
  - Target: ≤3 new files per feature
  - Red flag: >5 new files

□ **Count dependencies**: How many new imports/packages?
  - Target: 0 new packages (reuse existing)
  - Red flag: >2 new packages

□ **Count patterns**: How many new design patterns?
  - Target: Reuse existing patterns (mixins, singletons, etc.)
  - Red flag: Introducing new patterns without justification

□ **Count abstractions**: How many layers of indirection?
  - Target: ≤2 layers (interface → implementation)
  - Red flag: >3 layers (over-engineering)

### Phase 2: Reuse Identification (10 minutes)

□ **Search existing code**: What similar functionality exists?
  - Use: `grep -r "class.*Manager" coffee_maker/` to find managers
  - Use: `grep -r "def.*validate" coffee_maker/` to find validators
  - Document findings in spec

□ **Identify patterns**: What patterns are already in use?
  - Check: `docs/architecture/decisions/ADR-*.md` for established patterns
  - Verify: New spec follows existing patterns

□ **Find utilities**: What utilities can be reused?
  - Check: `coffee_maker/utils/` for existing utilities
  - Check: `coffee_maker/validation.py` for validators
  - Check: `coffee_maker/config/` for config management

□ **Analyze duplication**: Will this create duplicated code?
  - Run: `grep -A5 "def " coffee_maker/**/*.py | sort | uniq -d` to find similar methods
  - Document: Where duplication will occur and how to prevent it

### Phase 3: Factorization Opportunities (10 minutes)

□ **Extract common code**: What can be factored out NOW?
  - Identify: Shared logic across components
  - Create: Base classes, mixins, or utilities

□ **Plan abstractions**: What SHOULD be abstracted?
  - Identify: Patterns that will be used >2 times
  - Design: Reusable components with clear interfaces

□ **Simplify interfaces**: Can APIs be simpler?
  - Target: Methods with ≤3 parameters
  - Target: Classes with ≤5 public methods

□ **Reduce boilerplate**: What can be automated?
  - Identify: Repetitive code patterns
  - Provide: Code snippets or templates

### Phase 4: Implementation Shortcuts (15 minutes)

□ **Provide code snippets**: Copy-paste ready examples
  - Include: Complete, working code for key components
  - Format: Properly formatted with docstrings

□ **Identify libraries**: What existing libraries help?
  - Check: `pyproject.toml` for already-installed packages
  - Prefer: Standard library over new dependencies

□ **Create templates**: What can be templated?
  - Provide: File templates with placeholders
  - Example: Test file templates, class templates

□ **Document shortcuts**: What's the fastest implementation path?
  - Provide: Step-by-step implementation order
  - Estimate: Hours per step (be realistic!)

## Simplification Patterns

### Pattern 1: Phased Rollout

**When to Use**: Feature has high complexity

**Approach**:
```
Phase 1 (MVP): Simplest version that provides value (4 hours)
Phase 2 (Enhanced): Add important features (8 hours)
Phase 3 (Complete): Add nice-to-have features (optional)
```

**Benefits**:
- Delivers value quickly
- Allows learning from Phase 1 before Phase 2
- Can defer or skip Phase 3 if not needed

### Pattern 2: Extend, Don't Rebuild

**When to Use**: Similar functionality already exists

**Approach**:
1. Find existing code that does something similar
2. Identify what's missing
3. Add missing functionality to existing code
4. Update existing tests

**Benefits**:
- Leverages existing, tested code
- Reduces new code by 60-80%
- Maintains consistency

**Example**:
```
❌ DON'T: Create new CacheManager class
✅ DO: Add caching methods to existing ConfigManager class
```

### Pattern 3: Base Class + Specialization

**When to Use**: Multiple similar components

**Approach**:
1. Create base class with common functionality
2. Create specialized subclasses for variations
3. Keep base class abstract and focused

**Benefits**:
- Eliminates duplication
- Makes adding new specializations trivial
- Centralizes common logic

**Example**:
```python
# Base class (80% of code)
class BaseCommand(ABC):
    def execute(self, args) -> int:
        try:
            return self._execute_impl(args)
        except Exception as e:
            return self.handle_error(e)

    @abstractmethod
    def _execute_impl(self, args) -> int:
        pass

# Specialization (20% of code)
class ViewCommand(BaseCommand):
    def _execute_impl(self, args) -> int:
        priorities = self._get_priorities()
        print(self._format(priorities))
        return 0
```

### Pattern 4: Utility Functions > Class Hierarchies

**When to Use**: Simple, stateless operations

**Approach**:
1. Avoid creating classes for stateless operations
2. Use module-level functions instead
3. Group related functions in utility modules

**Benefits**:
- Simpler to understand
- Easier to test
- Less boilerplate

**Example**:
```python
# ❌ DON'T: Create class for simple operations
class StringUtils:
    def truncate(self, text: str, max_len: int) -> str:
        return text[:max_len] + "..." if len(text) > max_len else text

# ✅ DO: Simple utility function
def truncate(text: str, max_len: int) -> str:
    """Truncate text to max length with ellipsis."""
    return text[:max_len] + "..." if len(text) > max_len else text
```

### Pattern 5: Configuration > Code

**When to Use**: Behavior varies by deployment/use case

**Approach**:
1. Extract variable behavior to configuration
2. Use existing ConfigManager
3. Provide sensible defaults

**Benefits**:
- No code changes for behavior changes
- Easier testing (change config, not code)
- Clearer what's configurable

**Example**:
```python
# ❌ DON'T: Hardcode behavior
class CacheManager:
    def __init__(self):
        self.ttl = 3600  # Hardcoded
        self.max_size = 1000  # Hardcoded

# ✅ DO: Configuration-driven
class CacheManager:
    def __init__(self, config: Optional[CacheConfig] = None):
        config = config or CacheConfig.from_env()
        self.ttl = config.ttl
        self.max_size = config.max_size
```

## Simplification Examples

### Example 1: REFACTOR-001 (CLI Commands)

**Original Complexity**:
- 2 monolithic files (1,593 and 1,559 lines)
- 12+ commands mixed with routing logic
- Hard to test individual commands

**Simplification Applied**:
```
1. Pattern: Base Class + Specialization
   - Created BaseCommand with common functionality
   - Each command is now <150 lines
   - 80% of code reused

2. Factorization:
   - Extracted common error handling
   - Extracted common formatting utilities
   - Extracted command registration logic

3. Result:
   - Implementation effort reduced by 40%
   - Each new command: <1 hour vs. 3-4 hours before
   - Testing effort reduced by 60%
```

### Example 2: REFACTOR-002 (Pattern Extraction)

**Original Complexity**:
- 15+ extraction methods duplicated across 3 files
- 600-800 lines of duplicated code
- Inconsistent error handling

**Simplification Applied**:
```
1. Pattern: Consolidate into Single Class
   - Created PatternExtractor with all patterns
   - Single source of truth for regex patterns
   - Consistent error handling

2. Factorization:
   - Extracted common parsing logic
   - Added caching for performance
   - Created reusable parsers

3. Result:
   - Implementation effort reduced by 70%
   - Code reduced by 400-500 lines
   - Future pattern additions: 10 minutes vs. 1 hour before
```

### Example 3: SPEC-045 (Daemon Fix)

**Original Complexity**:
- Phase 2: Full Tool Use API integration (5-7 hours)
- Complex multi-step protocol
- High risk of Tool Use API issues

**Simplification Applied**:
```
1. Pattern: Phased Rollout
   - Phase 1: Template-based fallback (1 hour) - IMMEDIATE FIX
   - Phase 2: Tool Use API (5-7 hours) - PROPER SOLUTION
   - Hybrid approach with graceful fallback

2. Factorization:
   - Created SpecTemplateManager (reusable)
   - Enhanced ClaudeAPI (reusable for other tools)

3. Result:
   - Daemon unblocked in 1 hour (vs. 6-8 hours)
   - Lower risk (fallback always works)
   - Better user experience (graceful degradation)
```

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

### Anti-Pattern 1: Premature Optimization

**Symptom**: Designing for scale before needed

**Example**:
```
❌ BAD: "We might need to support 1M users, so let's use distributed caching, sharding, and Redis cluster"
✅ GOOD: "We have 100 users. In-memory cache is fine. Upgrade when we hit 1,000 users."
```

### Anti-Pattern 2: Over-Abstraction

**Symptom**: Creating abstractions for future flexibility

**Example**:
```
❌ BAD: "Let's create AbstractCacheFactory, CacheStrategy, CacheProvider, ICacheService..."
✅ GOOD: "Let's create CacheManager class. If we need multiple cache backends later, we can refactor."
```

### Anti-Pattern 3: Not Invented Here (NIH)

**Symptom**: Rebuilding existing functionality

**Example**:
```
❌ BAD: "I'll write my own JSON parser to handle edge cases"
✅ GOOD: "The standard library json module handles 99.9% of cases. Use it."
```

### Anti-Pattern 4: Feature Creep

**Symptom**: Adding features "while we're at it"

**Example**:
```
❌ BAD: "While implementing caching, let's also add analytics, monitoring, and A/B testing"
✅ GOOD: "Focus on caching. Other features can be separate specs."
```

### Anti-Pattern 5: Gold Plating

**Symptom**: Making code "perfect" before shipping

**Example**:
```
❌ BAD: "Let's add comprehensive logging, metrics, alerts, and dashboards before launching"
✅ GOOD: "Basic logging is enough for Phase 1. Add observability based on actual issues."
```

## Implementation Guidelines

### When Creating a Spec

```markdown
# SPEC-XXX: Feature Name

**Complexity Analysis**:
- New files: 2 (target: ≤3) ✅
- New dependencies: 0 (target: 0) ✅
- Lines of code: ~250 (target: <300) ✅
- Code reuse: 60% (target: >50%) ✅
- Implementation time: 8 hours (target: <2 days) ✅

**Reuse Opportunities**:
- Extends: coffee_maker/cli/commands/base.py (BaseCommand)
- Reuses: coffee_maker/autonomous/roadmap_parser.py (RoadmapParser)
- Leverages: coffee_maker/config/manager.py (ConfigManager)

**Factorization**:
- Common logic extracted to: coffee_maker/utils/helpers.py
- Pattern: Command Pattern (already in use for CLI)
- Base class: Provides 70% of functionality

**Implementation Shortcuts**:
- Template: [Provide complete code template]
- Step 1: Copy base.py template (15 min)
- Step 2: Implement _execute_impl() (2 hours)
- Step 3: Add tests (1 hour)
- Total: ~4 hours (realistic estimate)

[Rest of spec...]
```

### When Reviewing code_developer's Work

**After Implementation**:
1. Review actual code for duplication
2. Identify refactoring opportunities immediately
3. Create micro-refactoring specs (<2 hours each)
4. Prevent technical debt from accumulating

**Example**:
```
code_developer implements SPEC-010 (user-listener)
→ architect reviews implementation
→ Identifies: Duplication in error handling across 3 new files
→ Creates: REFACTOR-XXX - Extract common error handling (1 hour)
→ code_developer refactors immediately (before moving on)
```

## Real-World Examples

### Success Story: US-035 (Singleton Pattern)

**Before Simplification**:
- Complex locking mechanism
- Manual registration/unregistration
- Easy to forget cleanup
- 50+ lines per agent

**After Simplification**:
- Context manager for automatic cleanup
- Single line: `with AgentRegistry.register(AgentType.X):`
- Impossible to forget cleanup
- 3 lines per agent

**Result**: 95% reduction in boilerplate code

### Success Story: Prompt Centralization

**Before Simplification**:
- Prompts hardcoded in daemon code
- 20+ locations to update
- Inconsistent prompt formats
- Hard to A/B test

**After Simplification**:
- Centralized in `.claude/commands/`
- Single source of truth
- Consistent templating with placeholders
- Easy to version and test

**Result**: 80% reduction in prompt management effort

## Conclusion

**Simplification is not optional** - it's the architect's primary responsibility.

**Every spec should be reviewed through the lens of**:
1. Can this be eliminated?
2. Can this reuse existing code?
3. Can this be factored out?
4. Can this be simpler?

**Success = Making code_developer's job 50% easier**

Not through complex abstractions, but through ruthless simplification.
