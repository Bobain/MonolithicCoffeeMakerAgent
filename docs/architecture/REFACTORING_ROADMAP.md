- Phase 1 & 2 → Integration Tests (test refactored code)

### Recommended Order (Optimized)

**Week 1**:
1. REFACTOR-003 (Mon-Wed)
2. REFACTOR-001 (Thu-Fri, start)

**Week 2**:
1. REFACTOR-001 (Mon-Tue, finish)
2. Fix TODO/FIXME (Wed-Thu)
3. REFACTOR-002 (Fri, start)

**Week 3**:
1. REFACTOR-002 (Mon-Tue, finish)
2. REFACTOR-004 (Wed-Thu)
3. REFACTOR-005 (Fri)

## Risk Management

### Risk 1: Breaking Existing Functionality

**Probability**: MEDIUM
**Impact**: HIGH
**Mitigation**:
- ✅ Comprehensive test suite before refactoring
- ✅ Incremental changes (one module at a time)
- ✅ Feature flags for risky changes
- ✅ Code review by architect before merge

### Risk 2: Timeline Slippage

**Probability**: MEDIUM
**Impact**: MEDIUM
**Mitigation**:
- ✅ Daily progress updates
- ✅ Weekly checkpoints with team
- ✅ Prioritize by ROI (deliver value early)
- ✅ Cut scope if needed (drop Phase 3 if timeline tight)

### Risk 3: Regression Bugs

**Probability**: LOW
**Impact**: HIGH
**Mitigation**:
- ✅ Run full test suite after each refactoring
- ✅ Manual smoke testing of critical paths
- ✅ Staged rollout (feature flags)
- ✅ Quick rollback plan
