## Detailed Review

### SPEC-050: Architect POC Creation Framework (US-050)

**Status**: ✅ **READY FOR IMPLEMENTATION**

**Strengths**:
- ✅ Clear POC decision matrix (effort vs complexity)
- ✅ Well-defined POC structure (POC-072 as template)
- ✅ Reuses existing patterns (DeveloperStatus JSON, Click CLI)
- ✅ Architecture reuse check complete (100% reuse of existing patterns)
- ✅ Comprehensive README template for POCs
- ✅ Integration with architect workflow clearly defined

**Completeness Check**:
- ✅ Prerequisites & Dependencies: Clear (POC-072 as reference, no new dependencies)
- ✅ Architecture Overview: Excellent (decision matrix + workflow diagrams)
- ✅ Component Specifications: Detailed (`_should_create_poc()`, `_create_poc()` methods)
- ✅ Implementation Plan: 3 phases with time estimates (2-3 hours, 3-4 hours, 2-3 hours)
- ✅ Testing Strategy: Manual testing checklist provided
- ✅ Success Criteria: Functional + Quality + UX criteria defined
- ✅ Risk Analysis: 3 risks with mitigations

**Recommendations**:
1. **Add integration test plan**: Currently only manual tests specified. Add:
   - `test_poc_creation_workflow()` - End-to-end POC creation
   - `test_decision_matrix_logic()` - Verify decision matrix rules
   - `test_poc_template_generation()` - Validate README generation

2. **Clarify POC code generation**: Spec mentions "TODO: Generate skeleton Python files (future)". Should this be included in Phase 1 or deferred to Phase 2?

**Estimated Effort**: 8-16 hours (as specified)

**Blockers**: None

**Priority Order**: Can start immediately (no dependencies)

### SPEC-054: Architect Daily Integration of code-searcher Findings (US-054)

**Status**: ⚠️ **NEEDS MINOR UPDATES**

**Strengths**:
- ✅ Strong architecture reuse (DeveloperStatus pattern, CLI pattern, Validation exceptions)
- ✅ Clear enforcement mechanism (CFR011ViolationError)
- ✅ Comprehensive component specifications (ArchitectDailyRoutine class)
- ✅ Detailed CLI command implementations
- ✅ Integration with daemon spec manager workflow

**Issues Found**:
1. **Missing dependency specification**:
   - Uses `read_json()` and `write_json()` from `coffee_maker.utils.file_io`
   - Spec doesn't verify these utilities exist or specify creation if missing
   - **Impact**: code_developer may get blocked if file_io utilities don't exist

2. **Codebase analysis implementation unclear**:
   - Line 384: "TODO: Implement actual codebase analysis"
   - **Question**: What should "analyze-codebase" command actually do? Spec needs to clarify:
     - Radon complexity analysis?
     - Code smell detection?
     - Duplication detection?
     - All of the above?

3. **Integration point missing validation**:
   - Line 444-473: Shows integration with `daemon_spec_manager.py`
   - Doesn't specify how to handle case where `DeveloperStatus` class doesn't have notifications attribute
   - Should verify `self.notifications` exists before calling

**Completeness Check**:
- ✅ Prerequisites & Dependencies: Mostly clear (needs file_io clarification)
- ✅ Architecture Overview: Excellent diagrams and data flow
- ✅ Component Specifications: Very detailed
- ⚠️ Implementation Plan: Good but codebase analysis needs detail
- ✅ Testing Strategy: Comprehensive unit tests + integration tests
- ✅ Success Criteria: Well-defined
- ✅ Risk Analysis: 3 risks with mitigations

**Required Updates**:
1. Add **Prerequisites section** explicitly stating:
   - `coffee_maker.utils.file_io` module with `read_json()` and `write_json()` utilities
   - If doesn't exist, specify implementation (or reference existing implementation)

2. Expand **codebase analysis specification** (lines 376-385):
   ```python
   def analyze_codebase():
       """Perform weekly codebase analysis.

       Analysis includes:
       1. Radon complexity metrics (--average)
       2. Code duplication detection (radon raw)
       3. Large file detection (>500 LOC)
       4. Missing test coverage gaps
       5. TODO/FIXME comment extraction

       Output: Synthetic 1-2 page report saved to docs/architecture/
       """
   ```

3. Add validation in **integration code** (line 468):
   ```python
   if hasattr(self, 'notifications'):
       self.notifications.create_notification(...)
   else:
       logger.warning("Notifications not available, logging CFR-011 violation")
   ```

**Estimated Effort**: 8-16 hours (as specified) + 2 hours for updates

**Blockers**: ⚠️ Needs clarification on file_io utilities before implementation

**Priority Order**: Start after updates complete

## Critical Findings

### 1. Dependency Chain (Important for Sequencing)

```
SPEC-050 (POC Framework) ────────┐
                                 │
SPEC-054 (Architect Daily) ──────┼──────> Can run in parallel
                                 │
SPEC-055 (Skills Phase 1) ───────┘
         │
         └──> SPEC-056 (Skills Phase 2)
                       │
                       └──> SPEC-057 (Skills Phase 3)
```

**Recommendation**: Start SPEC-050, SPEC-054, and SPEC-055 in parallel. Wait for SPEC-055 before starting SPEC-056/057.

### 2. Pre-Approved Dependencies Verification Needed

**SPEC-055**:
- ✅ pyyaml>=3.0 (pre-approved - see SPEC-070)

**SPEC-056**:
- ⚠️ bandit>=1.7 (needs verification - not in SPEC-070 pre-approved list)
- ⚠️ safety>=2.0 (needs verification - not in SPEC-070 pre-approved list)

**SPEC-057**:
- ⚠️ pixelmatch>=5.0 (needs verification - not in SPEC-070 pre-approved list)

**ACTION REQUIRED**: Verify these dependencies are pre-approved or add to pre-approval list via architect.

### 3. Context Budget Risk (CFR-007)

All skills specs claim to fit within CFR-007 (≤30% agent context), but this is **estimated, not validated**.

**Recommendation**:
- Add explicit context budget testing in SPEC-055 Phase 1
- Test methodology: Load all agent required files + skill metadata, measure token count
- If >30%: Apply SPEC-057 optimization strategies early (don't wait for Phase 3)
