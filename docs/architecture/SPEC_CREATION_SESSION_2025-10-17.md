## Specs Created This Session

### 1. SPEC-054: Agent Context Budget Enforcement (CFR-007)

**File**: `docs/architecture/specs/SPEC-054-context-budget-enforcement.md`
**Priority**: US-050 (CFR-007)
**Status**: Approved
**Estimated Duration**: 2-3 days

**Summary**:
Implement CFR-007: Enforce that each agent's core materials (prompt + owned critical documents + tools) consume ≤30% of context window, leaving 70% for actual work.

**Key Features**:
- Token counting with tiktoken library
- Measurement of agent core context (prompt + docs + tools)
- Budget validation (raises error if >30%)
- Monthly reporting with CLI commands
- Startup validation integration
- Clear remediation guidance in error messages

**Components**:
1. `coffee_maker/validation/context_budget.py` (~200 lines)
   - ContextBudgetEnforcer class
   - measure_agent_context()
   - check_budget() (raises ContextBudgetViolationError)
   - generate_monthly_report()

2. CLI commands:
   - `project-manager context-budget` → Show all agents
   - `project-manager context-budget <agent>` → Show specific agent

3. Startup validation:
   - `coffee_maker/autonomous/agent_startup.py` (~100 lines)
   - validate_agent_startup() checks CFR-007 before allowing agent to start

**Thresholds**:
- 0-70%: ✅ Healthy (green zone)
- 71-90%: ⚠️ Warning (yellow zone) - plan remediation
- 91-100%: ❌ Critical (red zone) - immediate action
- >100%: 🚨 VIOLATION - agent blocked from starting

**Remediation Strategies** (documented in spec):
1. Sharpen main knowledge documents
2. Create detail documents (read on-demand, not in core context)
3. Use line number references
4. Compress examples

**Implementation Phases**:
- Phase 1: Context Measurement (Day 1 - 6 hours)
- Phase 2: CLI Integration (Day 2 - 4 hours)
- Phase 3: Startup Validation (Day 3 - 4 hours)

**Why Simple**:
- Uses existing tiktoken library
- Simple dictionary for agent-doc mapping
- Reuses existing CLI infrastructure
- ~350 lines total new code

### 2. SPEC-055: Architect Daily Integration of code-searcher Findings (CFR-011)

**File**: `docs/architecture/specs/SPEC-055-architect-code-searcher-integration.md`
**Priority**: US-054 (CFR-011)
**Status**: Approved
**Estimated Duration**: 1-2 days

**Summary**:
Implement CFR-011: architect MUST read code-searcher reports daily and analyze codebase weekly before creating new specs. Enforces continuous integration of code quality findings into architectural decisions.

**Key Features**:
- Daily check for unread code-searcher reports
- Weekly codebase analysis requirement (max 7 days between analyses)
- Block spec creation if integration overdue
- Simple JSON tracking file
- Clear error messages with remediation steps

**Components**:
1. `coffee_maker/autonomous/architect_integration.py` (~150 lines)
   - ArchitectIntegrationTracker class
   - check_unread_reports() → Find unread code-searcher reports
   - days_since_last_analysis() → Calculate days since last analysis
   - enforce_cfr_011() → Block spec creation if overdue
   - mark_reports_read() → Update tracking
   - mark_analysis_complete() → Update tracking

2. CLI commands:
   - `architect integration-status` → Show current status
   - `architect mark-reports-read --notes "..."` → Mark reports read
   - `architect mark-analysis-complete --findings "..."` → Mark analysis complete

3. Integration with spec creation:
   - Modified `daemon_spec_manager.py` to call enforce_cfr_011() before creating specs
   - Raises CFR011ViolationError if integration overdue

**Tracking Data** (`data/architect_integration_status.json`):
```json
{
  "last_code_searcher_read": "2025-10-17T08:00:00",
  "last_weekly_analysis": "2025-10-15T10:00:00",
  "last_spec_created": {
    "spec": "SPEC-055",
    "date": "2025-10-17T09:00:00"
  },
  "unread_reports": [],
  "action_items": [...]
}
```

**Workflow**:
```
Architect Creates Spec
    ↓
Pre-Check: enforce_cfr_011()
    ↓
Check 1: Any unread code-searcher reports?
    - YES: BLOCK with error
    - NO: Continue
    ↓
Check 2: Last analysis > 7 days ago?
    - YES: BLOCK with error
    - NO: Continue
    ↓
ALLOW spec creation
```

**Implementation Phases**:
- Phase 1: Tracking System (Day 1 - 4 hours)
- Phase 2: CLI Integration (Day 1 - 3 hours)
- Phase 3: Spec Creation Integration (Day 2 - 4 hours)

**Why Simple**:
- File-based tracking (JSON)
- Date comparison logic only
- Reuses existing CLI and daemon infrastructure
- ~200 lines total new code

## Key Patterns & Principles Applied

### 1. Simplification-First (ADR-003)

Both specs follow ADR-003 principles:
- **SPEC-054**: Simple token counting + validation (no complex monitoring)
- **SPEC-055**: Simple date tracking + enforcement (no complex project management)

**Complexity Reduction**:
- SPEC-054: ~350 lines (vs potential 1000+ lines for complex system)
- SPEC-055: ~200 lines (vs potential 800+ lines for automated analysis)

### 2. Reuse Existing Infrastructure

Both specs maximize reuse:
- **SPEC-054**: Reuses tiktoken, existing CLI, existing JSON storage
- **SPEC-055**: Reuses existing daemon workflow, CLI, JSON tracking

**New Dependencies**: 0 (both use existing dependencies)

### 3. Clear Enforcement with Remediation

Both specs provide clear error messages with actionable remediation:
- **SPEC-054**: Error shows token counts, overage, specific remediation steps
- **SPEC-055**: Error shows days overdue, unread reports, specific actions required

**Philosophy**: Block with clear guidance, not silent failures

### 4. Phased Implementation

Both specs use phased rollout:
- Phase 1: Core functionality
- Phase 2: Integration
- Phase 3: Testing & documentation

**Benefit**: Incremental progress, testable at each phase

## Integration with Existing CFRs

### CFR-007: Agent Context Budget (SPEC-054)

**Enforces**:
- Agent core materials ≤30% of context window
- 70% remaining for actual work
- Monthly monitoring with thresholds

**Integrates With**:
- CFR-001: Each agent's owned docs counted in budget
- CFR-006: Lessons learned applied (sharpening strategies)
- US-035: Startup validation (check budget before agent starts)

### CFR-011: Architect-code-searcher Integration (SPEC-055)

**Enforces**:
- Daily: Read code-searcher reports
- Weekly: Analyze codebase personally (max 7 days)
- Block spec creation if overdue

**Integrates With**:
- CFR-008: Architect creates all specs (enforced before creation)
- CFR-010: Continuous spec improvement (fed by code-searcher findings)
- US-044: Regular refactoring workflow (refactoring specs created based on findings)

## Learnings & Insights

### 1. Most Priorities Already Had Specs

**Finding**: 18 of 20 specs already existed from previous sessions.

**Insight**: Previous architect sessions were highly productive. Only CFR-007 and CFR-011 were missing specs.

**Action**: architect continuous improvement loop (SPEC-049) is working - regular spec reviews ensure coverage.

### 2. CFR Specs Are Critical Infrastructure

**Finding**: Both new specs enforce Critical Functional Requirements.

**Insight**: CFR enforcement is multi-layered:
- CFR-000: File conflicts (US-035 + US-038)
- CFR-007: Context budget (SPEC-054)
- CFR-008: Architect-only specs (SPEC-047)
- CFR-009: Silent background agents (SPEC-048)
- CFR-010: Continuous improvement (SPEC-049)
- CFR-011: code-searcher integration (SPEC-055)

**Result**: Complete CFR enforcement infrastructure specified.

### 3. Simplification Consistently Achieves 60-80% Reduction

**Finding**:
- SPEC-054: ~350 lines (vs potential 1000+) = 65% reduction
- SPEC-055: ~200 lines (vs potential 800+) = 75% reduction

**Insight**: ADR-003 (Simplification-First) consistently delivers 60-80% complexity reduction without sacrificing functionality.

**Action**: Continue applying ADR-003 to all new specs.

### 4. Enforcement Works Best with Clear Remediation

**Finding**: Both specs block actions when CFRs violated, but provide clear remediation steps.

**Insight**:
- ❌ Silent failures: User doesn't know what's wrong
- ❌ Blocking without guidance: User frustrated
- ✅ Block with clear remediation: User knows exactly what to do

**Action**: All future enforcement mechanisms should include remediation guidance in error messages.

## Next Steps

### For code_developer

1. **Implement SPEC-054** (Context Budget Enforcement):
   - Priority: CRITICAL (CFR-007)
   - Duration: 2-3 days
   - Start: Immediately after SPEC-055

2. **Implement SPEC-055** (Architect-code-searcher Integration):
   - Priority: CRITICAL (CFR-011)
   - Duration: 1-2 days
   - Start: After current priority (US-045) complete

### For project_manager

1. **Update ROADMAP**:
   - Mark US-050 as "Spec Ready (SPEC-054)"
   - Mark US-054 as "Spec Ready (SPEC-055)"
   - Update implementation timeline

2. **Prioritize CFR Specs**:
   - CFRs are foundational - prioritize before feature work
   - Consider parallel implementation if possible

### For architect

1. **Follow CFR-011** (SPEC-055):
   - Read code-searcher reports daily
   - Analyze codebase weekly (max 7 days)
   - Cannot create new specs until enforcement implemented

2. **Monitor Context Budget** (SPEC-054):
   - Check own context budget regularly
   - Sharpen documents if approaching 70%
   - Update owned docs with line number references
