# SPEC-045: Simplified Implementation Recommendations

**Author**: architect agent
**Date**: 2025-10-16
**Related**: SPEC-045-daemon-architect-delegation-fix.md
**Status**: Recommendation for code_developer

---

## Executive Summary

After reviewing SPEC-045 (1,136 lines, 6-8 hour estimate), I recommend **SIMPLIFYING to Phase 1 ONLY** (1-2 hours) to unblock the daemon immediately.

**Key Insight**: Phase 2 (Tool Use API integration) assumes Claude API can execute file operations, but this may not be available in the current daemon context. Implementing Phase 1 first validates the approach and unblocks daemon NOW.

---

## Current Situation (URGENT)

**CRITICAL**: Daemon is STUCK in infinite loop trying to create technical specs for PRIORITY 9.

**Root Cause**: daemon_spec_manager.py tries to "delegate" to architect via Claude API text generation, which doesn't create actual files.

**Impact**: ALL autonomous ROADMAP progress is BLOCKED.

---

## Recommended Approach: PHASE 1 ONLY

### What to Implement (1-2 hours)

**Step 1**: Create SpecTemplateManager Class (30 minutes)

**File**: `coffee_maker/autonomous/spec_template_manager.py`

```python
"""
Template-based Technical Specification Generator

Generates basic technical specifications from templates when architect
agent delegation is not available or fails. Provides immediate fallback
to unblock daemon.
"""

from pathlib import Path
from datetime import datetime
import logging

logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)


class SpecTemplateManager:
    """Generate technical specifications from templates.

    This provides a fallback mechanism when architect agent
    delegation is not available or fails.
    """

    def __init__(self, template_path: str = "docs/architecture/specs/SPEC-000-template.md"):
        """Initialize spec template manager.

        Args:
            template_path: Path to spec template file
        """
        self.template_path = Path(template_path)

    def create_spec_from_template(
        self,
        priority: dict,
        spec_filename: str,
        output_dir: str = "docs/architecture/specs"
    ) -> bool:
        """Create a basic technical spec from template.

        Args:
            priority: Priority dict with name, title, content
            spec_filename: Output filename (e.g., "SPEC-009-enhanced-communication.md")
            output_dir: Where to write spec

        Returns:
            True if spec created successfully, False otherwise

        Steps:
            1. Load template
            2. Extract priority details
            3. Fill template placeholders
            4. Add architect review TODO
            5. Write to output_dir
        """
        try:
            # Load template
            if not self.template_path.exists():
                logger.error(f"Template not found: {self.template_path}")
                return False

            template = self.template_path.read_text()

            # Extract details from priority
            priority_name = priority.get("name", "UNKNOWN")
            priority_title = priority.get("title", "Unknown Priority")
            priority_content = priority.get("content", "No content provided")

            # Fill template
            spec_content = template.replace("{PRIORITY_NAME}", priority_name)
            spec_content = spec_content.replace("{PRIORITY_TITLE}", priority_title)
            spec_content = spec_content.replace("{DATE}", datetime.now().strftime("%Y-%m-%d"))

            # Extract problem statement from content (first paragraph)
            problem_statement = self._extract_problem_statement(priority_content)
            spec_content = spec_content.replace("{PROBLEM_STATEMENT}", problem_statement)

            # Add architect review note
            review_note = (
                "\n\n⚠️ **TODO: This spec was auto-generated from template. "
                "Architect review recommended.**\n\n"
            )
            spec_content = spec_content.replace(
                "## Problem Statement",
                f"{review_note}## Problem Statement"
            )

            # Write to output
            output_path = Path(output_dir) / spec_filename
            output_path.parent.mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)
            output_path.write_text(spec_content)

            logger.info(f"Created spec from template: {output_path}")
            return True

        except Exception as e:
            logger.error(f"Failed to create spec from template: {e}", exc_info=True)
            return False

    def _extract_problem_statement(self, content: str) -> str:
        """Extract problem statement from priority content.

        Takes first paragraph or first 200 chars as problem statement.

        Args:
            content: Priority content from ROADMAP

        Returns:
            Problem statement text
        """
        if not content:
            return "No problem statement provided in ROADMAP."

        # Take first paragraph (up to first blank line)
        paragraphs = content.split("\n\n")

            return paragraphs[0].strip()

        # Fallback: first 200 chars
        return content[:200].strip() + "..."
```

**Step 2**: Update SpecManagerMixin with Fallback (20 minutes)

**File**: `coffee_maker/autonomous/daemon_spec_manager.py`

```python
def _ensure_technical_spec(self, priority: dict) -> bool:
    """Ensure technical spec exists using SIMPLIFIED fallback approach.

    Strategy (PHASE 1 ONLY):
        1. Check if spec already exists → return True
        2. Use template-based spec creation (SIMPLE FALLBACK)
        3. Verify spec was created

    Returns:
        True if spec exists or was created
    """
    priority_name = priority.get("name", "")
    spec_prefix = self._get_spec_prefix(priority_name)

    # Check if spec already exists
    if self._spec_exists(spec_prefix):
        logger.info(f"Technical spec already exists for {priority_name}")
        return True

    logger.info(f"Creating technical spec from template for {priority_name}...")

    # Use template-based spec creation (SIMPLE APPROACH)
    from coffee_maker.autonomous.spec_template_manager import SpecTemplateManager

    manager = SpecTemplateManager()
    spec_filename = f"{spec_prefix}-{priority_name.lower().replace(' ', '-').replace('_', '-')}.md"

    if manager.create_spec_from_template(
        priority=priority,
        spec_filename=spec_filename
    ):
        logger.info(f"✅ Spec created from template (architect review needed)")
        return True

    logger.error(f"❌ Failed to create spec using template")
    return False
```

**Step 3**: Test with PRIORITY 9 (10 minutes)

```bash
# Run daemon
poetry run code-developer --auto-approve

# Check if spec created
ls docs/architecture/specs/SPEC-009-*

# Verify daemon progressed
tail -20 logs/daemon.log
# Should show: "✅ Spec created from template"
```

## Why NOT Phase 2 (Tool Use API)?

### Concern 1: API Availability Uncertain

**Question**: Does Anthropic API in daemon context support Tool Use with actual file creation?

**Risk**: Spend 5-7 hours implementing Tool Use API integration, only to find:
- API doesn't support file creation in this context
- Requires different authentication
- Daemon subprocess doesn't have required permissions

**Mitigation**: Validate Tool Use API works FIRST, implement LATER.

---

### Concern 2: Template Approach May Be Sufficient

**Reality Check**: Template-based specs may be GOOD ENOUGH.

**Why**:
- Daemon gets unblocked (primary goal achieved)
- architect can manually review/enhance template specs later
- Template specs provide 80% of value (basic structure) in 20% of time
- Quality specs still come from architect, just after daemon creates baseline

**Philosophy**: Perfect is the enemy of done. Unblock daemon NOW, iterate LATER.

---

### Concern 3: Phase 2 Adds Complexity

**Phase 2 Tasks** (5-7 hours):
- Implement Tool Use API integration (3h)
- Add tool definitions (write_file, read_file, bash) (1h)
- Update delegation prompts (1h)
- Integration testing (2h)

**Question**: Is this complexity needed if Phase 1 works?

**Alternative**: architect manually reviews template specs weekly, enhances as needed.

---

## Benefits of Phase 1 Only

### Benefit 1: IMMEDIATE Unblock (1-2 hours)
- Daemon creates basic specs from template
- PRIORITY 9 has spec file
- Daemon moves to implementation phase
- No infinite loop

### Benefit 2: SIMPLE Solution (low risk)
- File I/O only (no API calls)
- Clear error handling
- Easy to test and debug
- No external dependencies

### Benefit 3: architect Still Reviews
- Template specs marked "TODO: architect review"
- architect enhances specs weekly
- Quality maintained through review, not automation

### Benefit 4: Validates Approach
- Proves template-based approach works
- Identifies what's missing in templates
- Informs whether Phase 2 is even needed

---

## Comparison: Phase 1 vs Full Implementation

| Aspect | Phase 1 Only | Full (Phase 1+2) |
|--------|--------------|------------------|
| **Time** | 1-2 hours | 6-8 hours |
| **Complexity** | Simple (file I/O) | Complex (API integration) |
| **Risk** | Low (proven approach) | Medium (API may not work) |
| **Unblock Time** | Immediate | After 6-8 hours |
| **Spec Quality** | 80% (needs review) | 95% (architect-generated) |
| **Maintenance** | Manual review needed | Mostly automated |
| **Validation** | None needed | Must validate Tool Use API |

**Verdict**: Phase 1 delivers 80% of value in 20% of time with LOW risk.

## Implementation Checklist (Phase 1 Only)

### Step 1: Create SpecTemplateManager (30 min)
- [ ] Create `coffee_maker/autonomous/spec_template_manager.py`
- [ ] Implement `create_spec_from_template()` method
- [ ] Add `_extract_problem_statement()` helper
- [ ] Add logging

### Step 2: Update SpecManagerMixin (20 min)
- [ ] Update `_ensure_technical_spec()` in daemon_spec_manager.py
- [ ] Import SpecTemplateManager
- [ ] Call `create_spec_from_template()` as fallback
- [ ] Remove Claude API delegation code (temporary)

### Step 3: Test with PRIORITY 9 (10 min)
- [ ] Run daemon: `poetry run code-developer --auto-approve`
- [ ] Verify spec created: `ls docs/architecture/specs/SPEC-009-*`
- [ ] Check daemon progressed: `tail logs/daemon.log`
- [ ] Verify no infinite loop (multiple iterations with different priorities)

---

## Success Criteria (Phase 1)

- ✅ Daemon creates spec from template for PRIORITY 9
- ✅ Spec file exists: `docs/architecture/specs/SPEC-009-enhanced-communication.md`
- ✅ Daemon proceeds to implementation phase
- ✅ No infinite loop detected (>3 iterations with progress)
- ✅ Template specs marked for architect review

---

## What Happens Next?

### Immediate (After Phase 1)
1. ✅ Daemon unblocked (can progress through ROADMAP)
2. ✅ PRIORITY 9 has basic technical spec
3. ✅ code_developer implements based on template spec

### Short-Term (Next Week)
1. architect manually reviews template specs
2. architect enhances specs with missing details
3. Evaluate if Phase 2 (Tool Use API) is needed

### Long-Term (Next Month)
1. IF template approach insufficient → implement Phase 2
2. IF template approach works → keep it simple
3. Document decision in ADR

---

## When to Consider Phase 2

**Consider Phase 2 IF**:
1. Template specs are consistently inadequate
2. Manual review takes >2 hours per week
3. Tool Use API validated to work correctly
4. Daemon creates >5 specs per week

**Don't Implement Phase 2 IF**:
1. Template specs are good enough
2. Manual review takes <1 hour per week
3. Daemon creates <3 specs per week
4. Tool Use API doesn't work as expected

---

## Recommendation for code_developer

**DO THIS** (1-2 hours):
1. Implement Phase 1 (template-based spec creation)
2. Test with PRIORITY 9
3. Verify daemon unblocked

**DON'T DO THIS** (yet):
1. Phase 2 (Tool Use API integration)
2. Complex delegation infrastructure
3. AI-powered spec generation

**Rationale**: Unblock daemon NOW, iterate LATER.

---

## Conclusion

**Summary**: Phase 1 (template-based) unblocks daemon in 1-2 hours with LOW risk. Phase 2 (Tool Use API) is 5-7 hours of MEDIUM risk work that may not be needed.

**Recommendation**: **IMPLEMENT PHASE 1 ONLY**, defer Phase 2 until validated.

**Next Steps**:
1. code_developer implements SpecTemplateManager (30 min)
2. code_developer updates daemon_spec_manager.py (20 min)
3. code_developer tests with PRIORITY 9 (10 min)
4. architect reviews template specs next week

**Status**: Ready for immediate implementation
