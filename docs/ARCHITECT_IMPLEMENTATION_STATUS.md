# Architect Implementation Status - Hierarchical Specs

**Date**: 2025-10-24
**Status**: ⚠️ PARTIALLY IMPLEMENTED

---

## Quick Answer

**No, the architect is NOT fully implemented for hierarchical specs in database.**

**Current State**:
- ✅ **Skill exists**: `technical-specification-handling` v2.0.0 with hierarchical support
- ✅ **File-based implementation**: Can create hierarchical spec directories
- ❌ **Database integration**: NOT implemented
- ❌ **Architect agent**: Does NOT use the hierarchical spec skill yet
- ❌ **Database writes**: `technical_specs` table has NO hierarchical columns

---

## What Exists ✅

### 1. Hierarchical Spec Skill (v2.0.0)

**Location**: `.claude/skills/shared/technical_specification_handling/`

**Capabilities**:
- Create hierarchical spec directories (`SPEC-{number}-{slug}/`)
- Progressive disclosure (README.md + phase files)
- Automatic phase detection for code_developer
- 71% context reduction
- Backward compatible with monolithic specs

**Functions**:
```python
# Creates directory structure
create_hierarchical(us_number, title, phases)

# Reads overview + current phase only
read_hierarchical(priority_id, phase=None)

# Detects current phase from ROADMAP/git/files
detect_current_phase(priority_id, spec_path)

# Converts monolithic → hierarchical
convert_to_hierarchical(spec_path, phase_count)
```

**Status**: ✅ **Implemented and tested** (v2.0.0, 2025-10-21)

---

### 2. Database Schema

**Table**: `technical_specs`

**Current Schema**:
```sql
CREATE TABLE technical_specs (
    id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
    spec_number INTEGER NOT NULL UNIQUE,
    title TEXT NOT NULL,
    roadmap_item_id TEXT,
    status TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT 'draft',
    spec_type TEXT DEFAULT 'monolithic',  -- ⚠️ Has this field!
    file_path TEXT,
    content TEXT,
    dependencies TEXT,
    estimated_hours REAL,
    actual_hours REAL,
    updated_at TEXT NOT NULL,
    updated_by TEXT NOT NULL,
    started_at TEXT,
    phase TEXT,
    plan_summary TEXT,
    plan_and_summary TEXT
);
```

**Observations**:
- ✅ Has `spec_type` field (can distinguish hierarchical vs monolithic)
- ✅ Has `phase` field (can track current phase)
- ❌ NO `total_phases` field
- ❌ NO `phase_files` JSON field
- ❌ NO hierarchical-specific metadata

---

## What's Missing ❌

### 1. Architect Agent Implementation

**Current architect files**:
- `coffee_maker/autonomous/architect_metrics.py`
- `coffee_maker/autonomous/architect_report_generator.py`
- `coffee_maker/autonomous/architect_review_triggers.py`
- `coffee_maker/autonomous/spec_generator.py` (generates specs from user stories)

**Missing**:
- ❌ NO integration with `technical-specification-handling` skill
- ❌ NO hierarchical spec creation code
- ❌ NO database writes for specs
- ❌ Spec generation is file-based only

**Current Approach**:
```python
# spec_generator.py generates TechnicalSpec dataclass
# But does NOT:
# 1. Write to database
# 2. Create hierarchical directories
# 3. Use the skill
```

---

### 2. Database Integration for Hierarchical Specs

**Missing Methods in RoadmapDatabase**:

```python
# NEEDED (not implemented):
def create_hierarchical_spec(
    self,
    spec_number: int,
    title: str,
    roadmap_item_id: str,
    phases: List[Dict],
    **kwargs
) -> str:
    """Create hierarchical spec entry in database."""
    # Should:
    # 1. Insert into technical_specs table
    # 2. Set spec_type = 'hierarchical'
    # 3. Store total_phases count
    # 4. Create file directory structure
    # 5. Return spec_id
    pass

def update_spec_phase(
    self,
    spec_id: str,
    current_phase: int
) -> bool:
    """Update current phase for hierarchical spec."""
    # Should:
    # 1. Validate phase number
    # 2. Update technical_specs.phase
    # 3. Log phase transition
    pass

def get_spec_by_roadmap_item(
    self,
    roadmap_item_id: str
) -> Optional[Dict]:
    """Get technical spec for a roadmap item."""
    # Should:
    # 1. Query technical_specs table
    # 2. Return spec metadata
    # 3. Include spec_type, phase info
    pass
```

**Current Database Methods**:
```python
# RoadmapDatabase HAS:
- get_items_with_specs()  # Returns items that have specs
- get_items_needing_specs()  # Returns items without specs
- claim_spec_work()  # Lock spec for architect
- release_spec_work()  # Unlock spec

# RoadmapDatabase DOES NOT HAVE:
- create_technical_spec()  # ❌ Missing
- update_technical_spec()  # ❌ Missing
- get_technical_spec()  # ❌ Missing
```

### 3. Architect Agent Workflow

**Missing Workflow**:
```python
# CURRENT (broken workflow):
1. architect reads ROADMAP
2. architect generates spec using spec_generator.py
3. architect writes spec to FILE ONLY (docs/architecture/specs/SPEC-XXX.md)
4. ❌ NO database entry created
5. ❌ NO hierarchical structure created
6. code_developer looks for spec by READING FILE SYSTEM

# NEEDED (database-driven workflow):
1. architect reads ROADMAP via RoadmapDatabase
2. architect identifies priority needing spec
3. architect claims spec work: claim_spec_work(roadmap_item_id)
4. architect generates hierarchical spec structure
5. architect writes to DATABASE: create_hierarchical_spec(...)
6. architect creates FILE directory structure (skill)
7. architect releases spec work: release_spec_work(roadmap_item_id)
8. code_developer queries DATABASE: get_spec_by_roadmap_item(...)
9. code_developer reads hierarchical spec (skill)
```

## Implementation Gap Analysis

### Gap 1: Database Write Methods

**Severity**: 🔴 CRITICAL

**Missing**:
- `RoadmapDatabase.create_technical_spec()`
- `RoadmapDatabase.update_technical_spec()`
- `RoadmapDatabase.get_technical_spec()`

**Why Critical**:
- Without these, architect CANNOT write specs to database
- File system and database are out of sync
- code_developer cannot reliably find specs

**Estimated Effort**: 2-3 hours

---

### Gap 2: Architect Agent Integration

**Severity**: 🔴 CRITICAL

**Missing**:
- Architect does NOT use `technical-specification-handling` skill
- Architect does NOT write to database
- Architect uses old file-based approach

**Why Critical**:
- Hierarchical spec architecture (PRIORITY 25) cannot be completed
- 71% context reduction benefit unrealized
- CFR-016 (incremental implementation) not fully supported

**Estimated Effort**: 4-6 hours

---

### Gap 3: Schema Enhancements

**Severity**: 🟡 MEDIUM

**Missing Fields in `technical_specs` table**:
- `total_phases` INTEGER (how many phases in spec)
- `phase_files` JSON (list of phase file names)
- `current_phase_status` TEXT (in_progress, completed)

**Why Medium**:
- Can work without these (use file system as source of truth)
- But better to have for querying and validation

**Estimated Effort**: 1 hour

---

## Current Priorities

**From ROADMAP.md**:
```
PRIORITY 25: Hierarchical, Modular Technical Specification Architecture
Status: 📝 Planned - Phase 4 (Spec Migration)
```

**Phases**:
- ✅ Phase 1: Core skill development (COMPLETE)
- ✅ Phase 2: Daemon integration (COMPLETE)
- ✅ Phase 3: Guidelines library (COMPLETE)
- ⚠️ Phase 4: Spec migration (PLANNED - **THIS IS THE DATABASE INTEGRATION**)

---

## Recommendation

### Immediate Actions (Phase 4 Implementation)

**1. Add Database Write Methods** (2-3 hours)
```python
# In coffee_maker/autonomous/roadmap_database.py

def create_technical_spec(
    self,
    spec_number: int,
    title: str,
    roadmap_item_id: str,
    spec_type: str,  # 'hierarchical' or 'monolithic'
    file_path: str,
    phases: Optional[List[Dict]] = None,
    **kwargs
) -> str:
    """Create technical spec entry."""
    if not self.can_write:
        raise PermissionError(f"Only architect can create specs, not {self.agent_name}")

    now = datetime.now().isoformat()
    spec_id = f"SPEC-{spec_number:03d}"

    conn = sqlite3.connect(self.db_path)
    cursor = conn.cursor()

    cursor.execute(
        """
        INSERT INTO technical_specs (
            id, spec_number, title, roadmap_item_id,
            status, spec_type, file_path,
            updated_at, updated_by
        ) VALUES (?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?)
        """,
        (
            spec_id,
            spec_number,
            title,
            roadmap_item_id,
            'draft',
            spec_type,
            file_path,
            now,
            self.agent_name
        )
    )

    conn.commit()
    conn.close()

    return spec_id
```

**2. Integrate Skill in Architect** (4-6 hours)

Update architect workflow to:
1. Use `RoadmapDatabase.create_technical_spec()`
2. Use `technical-specification-handling` skill
3. Create hierarchical structure
4. Write to both database AND file system

**3. Schema Migration** (1 hour)

Add optional enhancement fields:
```sql
ALTER TABLE technical_specs ADD COLUMN total_phases INTEGER;
ALTER TABLE technical_specs ADD COLUMN phase_files TEXT;  -- JSON
ALTER TABLE technical_specs ADD COLUMN current_phase_status TEXT;
```

**4. Update code_developer** (2 hours)

Update daemon to:
1. Query database for spec: `get_spec_by_roadmap_item()`
2. Use `read_hierarchical()` skill for progressive loading
3. Detect and load current phase only

- **ROADMAP**: `docs/roadmap/ROADMAP.md` - PRIORITY 25
- **CFR-016**: Incremental Implementation Steps
- **CFR-007**: Agent Context Budget (30% Maximum)

---

**Summary**: The skill and file-based implementation exist, but the architect agent does NOT use it and does NOT write to the database. PRIORITY 25 Phase 4 needs to be completed to enable full hierarchical spec support.
