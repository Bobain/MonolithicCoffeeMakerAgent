# Cost Tracking Implementation Summary

## Overview

Successfully implemented **Phase 3: Cost Tracking to Langfuse** from the rate limiting and cost optimization plan. The system now automatically calculates and logs LLM API costs to Langfuse for comprehensive cost monitoring and analysis.

## Implementation Date

2025-10-08

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Cost Calculation (`cost_calculator.py`)

Created a comprehensive `CostCalculator` class that:

- ✅ Calculates costs based on per-1M-token pricing from `MODEL_CONFIGS`
- ✅ Tracks cumulative costs by model and overall
- ✅ Maintains cost history with timestamps
- ✅ Provides cost statistics by timeframe (all/day/hour/minute)
- ✅ Handles free-tier models (reports $0.00 cost)
- ✅ Supports cost breakdown by input/output tokens

**Key Features:**
```python
# Calculate cost for a request
cost_info = cost_calculator.calculate_cost("openai/gpt-4o-mini", input_tokens=1000, output_tokens=500)
# Returns: {'input_cost': 0.00015, 'output_cost': 0.0003, 'total_cost': 0.00045, ...}

# Get cumulative cost stats
stats = cost_calculator.get_cost_stats(timeframe="day")
# Returns: total cost, cost by model, request count, token counts, avg cost per request
```

### 2. AutoPickerLLM Cost Integration (`auto_picker_llm.py`)

Enhanced `AutoPickerLLM` to automatically calculate and log costs:

- ✅ Extracts actual token counts from LLM responses (supports both `response_metadata` and `usage_metadata` formats)
- ✅ Calculates cost after each LLM invocation
- ✅ Uses actual token counts for rate limiting (more accurate than estimates)
- ✅ Logs cost data to Langfuse with comprehensive metadata
- ✅ Handles Langfuse errors gracefully (doesn't break LLM flow)
- ✅ Works with or without Langfuse client

**Metadata logged to Langfuse:**
- `cost_usd`: Total cost in USD
- `input_cost_usd`: Input token cost
- `output_cost_usd`: Output token cost
- `is_primary`: Whether primary or fallback model was used
- `latency_seconds`: Request latency
- Usage: `{input, output, total}` token counts

### 3. Cost Calculator Initialization (`create_auto_picker.py`)

Updated `create_auto_picker_llm()` to:

- ✅ Build pricing info from `MODEL_CONFIGS`
- ✅ Initialize `CostCalculator` with all model pricing
- ✅ Get Langfuse client for cost tracking
- ✅ Pass both to `AutoPickerLLM` instances

**Result:** Every `AutoPickerLLM` instance now automatically tracks costs.

### 4. Langfuse Dashboard Queries (`docs/langfuse_cost_queries.md`)

Created comprehensive documentation with:

- ✅ **8 SQL queries** for cost analysis in Langfuse
  - Total cost by model
  - Cost over time (daily/hourly)
  - Primary vs fallback usage and cost
  - Most expensive requests
  - Token efficiency analysis
  - Cumulative cost tracking
  - Cost distribution (percentiles)
  - Budget alerts

- ✅ **Dashboard recommendations**
  - Cost Monitoring Dashboard
  - Performance Dashboard

- ✅ **Python code examples** for programmatic cost fetching

- ✅ **Integration examples** with CostCalculator

### 5. Comprehensive Test Coverage (`test_cost_tracking.py`)

Created 7 new unit tests covering:

- ✅ Cost calculation for paid models
- ✅ Zero cost for free models
- ✅ Cost tracking without Langfuse
- ✅ Token extraction from usage_metadata
- ✅ Fallback model cost tracking
- ✅ Cumulative cost tracking
- ✅ Error handling (Langfuse errors don't break flow)

**Test Results:** All 50 unit tests pass (43 existing + 7 new)

## How It Works

### Flow Diagram

```
LLM Request → AutoPickerLLM.invoke()
                    ↓
            _try_invoke_model()
                    ↓
            Extract token counts from response
                    ↓
            CostCalculator.calculate_cost()
                    ↓
            Log to Langfuse (if available)
                    ↓
            Return response
```

### Example Usage

```python
from coffee_maker.langchain_observe.create_auto_picker import create_auto_picker_llm

# Create AutoPickerLLM with automatic cost tracking
auto_llm = create_auto_picker_llm(tier="tier1", streaming=True)

# Use it - costs are automatically tracked
response = auto_llm.invoke({"input": "Review this code..."})

# View cumulative costs
stats = auto_llm.cost_calculator.get_cost_stats(timeframe="day")
print(f"Total cost today: ${stats['total_cost_usd']:.4f}")
print(f"Requests: {stats['total_requests']}")
print(f"Average cost/request: ${stats['average_cost_per_request']:.4f}")

# View recent costs
recent = auto_llm.cost_calculator.get_recent_costs(limit=5)
for record in recent:
    print(f"{record.model}: ${record.total_cost:.4f}")
```

### Langfuse Dashboard

All costs are automatically logged to Langfuse. You can:

1. **View in Langfuse UI**: Navigate to Generations → see cost metadata
2. **Create custom dashboards**: Use SQL queries from `docs/langfuse_cost_queries.md`
3. **Set up alerts**: Configure budget alerts for daily/hourly spending
4. **Analyze trends**: Track costs over time, by model, by request type

## Cost Calculation Details

### Pricing Sources

Pricing is centralized in `llm_config.py`:

```python
"openai/gpt-4o-mini": {
    "pricing": {"input_per_1m": 0.150, "output_per_1m": 0.600}
}
"gemini/gemini-2.5-flash-lite": {
    "pricing": {"free": True}
}
```

### Calculation Formula

```python
input_cost = (input_tokens / 1_000_000) * pricing["input_per_1m"]
output_cost = (output_tokens / 1_000_000) * pricing["output_per_1m"]
total_cost = input_cost + output_cost
```

### Free Tier Models

Models marked as `"free": True` report $0.00 cost but still track token usage.

## Testing

All tests pass (50 total):
- 10 AutoPickerLLM tests
- 8 Global rate tracker tests
- 12 LLM tools tests
- 13 Rate limiter tests
- **7 Cost tracking tests (NEW)**

Run tests:
```bash
poetry run pytest tests/unit/ -v
```

## Benefits

1. **Comprehensive Cost Visibility**
   - Real-time cost tracking per request
   - Cumulative cost monitoring by model
   - Historical cost analysis

2. **Budget Control**
   - Set up alerts in Langfuse for spending limits
   - Track daily/hourly costs
   - Identify expensive requests

3. **Cost Optimization**
   - Compare primary vs fallback costs
   - Analyze token efficiency by model
   - Identify cost-saving opportunities

4. **Seamless Integration**
   - Works automatically with existing AutoPickerLLM
   - No code changes needed for cost tracking
   - Graceful degradation if Langfuse unavailable

## Next Steps (Optional Future Work)

From the original plan, these phases remain:

### Phase 4: Context Length Management
- Automatic truncation for oversized inputs
- Model selection based on context requirements
- Chunking strategies for very large inputs

### Phase 5: Budget Management
- Daily/monthly budget limits
- Automatic model downgrade when approaching limits
- Budget alerts and notifications

These can be implemented in the future as needed.

## Conclusion

✅ **Phase 3 Complete**: Cost tracking is fully implemented and tested.

The system now provides comprehensive cost visibility through:
- Automatic cost calculation based on token usage
- Real-time logging to Langfuse
- Rich analytics and dashboards
- Integration with existing rate limiting and fallback system

All costs are tracked automatically without requiring any changes to existing code that uses AutoPickerLLM.
