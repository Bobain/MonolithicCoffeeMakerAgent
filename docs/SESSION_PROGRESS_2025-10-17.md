# Session Progress Report - 2025-10-17

**Date**: 2025-10-17
**Time**: 10:00 AM - Current (work until 8 PM)
**Branch**: feature/us-047-architect-only-specs
**Status**: In Progress

## Overview

This session focused on consolidating work across multiple feature branches and preparing for final merge to main. The codebase has significant work implemented across many parallel feature branches that need to be integrated.

## Accomplishments This Session

### 1. Test Import Fixes
- Fixed imports in test files to use correct class names
  - `ClaudeCLI` → `ClaudeCLIInterface` in test files
- Updated test_daemon_regression.py with corrected DevDaemon parameters
- Tests now correctly reference current API signatures

### 2. Analysis of PR Status
- PR #125: test_daemon_regression.py integration tests - has dependency review and unit test failures
- PR #129: US-047 Architect-Only Spec Creation - also has test failures
- Root cause: Test fixtures and mocks need updates to match refactored code

### 3. Repository State Analysis
- **Current branch**: feature/us-047-architect-only-specs (ahead of origin/feature/us-047-architect-only-specs by 1 commit)
- **Main branch**: Last merge was #120 to roadmap
- **Active feature branches**: 20+ with significant work:
  - feature/priority-2.10-natural-responses
  - feature/priority-2.11-bug-workflow
  - feature/us-035-singleton-enforcement
  - feature/us-045-phase-1-template-fallback
  - feature/priority-9-phases-3-5
  - And many more...

## Current Issues

### 1. Test Failures Blocking Merges
- Deprecated tests in tests/unit/_deprecated/ causing import errors
- Test fixtures using old APIs (max_retries, verbose parameters no longer exist)
- ACE API tests have TypeErrors in setup
- Solution needed: Review and update all test fixtures

### 2. Import Inconsistencies
- daemon.py uses mixins from multiple modules (GitOpsMixin, SpecManagerMixin, etc.)
- Manual test files still referencing old class names
- Pre-commit hooks modifying files during commit

### 3. Feature Branch Explosion
- 20+ active feature branches with unmerged work
- High risk of conflicts during merge
- Unclear priority for which branches to merge first

## Critical Path Forward

### Phase 1: Immediate (Next 1-2 hours)
1. ✅ Fix test imports (DONE)
2. ✅ Push fixes to feature branch (DONE)
3. TODO: Review and fix test fixture issues in:
   - tests/unit/test_ace_api.py (PlaybookBullet.__init__ error)
   - tests/unit/test_daemon_architect_delegation.py
   - test files using deprecated modules

### Phase 2: Short-term (Next 2-3 hours)
1. Create comprehensive test suite that works with all changes
2. Ensure all core functionality tests pass
3. Clean up deprecated test files

### Phase 3: Integration (Next 2-3 hours)
1. Decide merge strategy for feature branches
2. Start with most critical branches (US-035, US-045 first)
3. Test each merge incrementally
4. Monitor for regressions

## Recommendations

### For Test Infrastructure
1. Create conftest.py fixtures that work with current daemon API
2. Mark slow tests with @pytest.mark.slow to run separately
3. Use monkeypatching for external dependencies (git, claude API)
4. Add environment variable fixtures for ANTHROPIC_API_KEY

### For Merging Strategy
1. Start with roadmap branch (base for all work)
2. Merge feature/us-047-architect-only-specs (current work)
3. Test incrementally with each merge
4. Use --no-ff for all merges to preserve history

### For CI/CD
1. Move deprecated tests to separate directory
2. Add test filtering in GitHub Actions
3. Create separate "slow" test job
4. Add test coverage reporting

## Technical Debt Identified
- 6 GitHub security vulnerabilities on default branch (2 high, 4 moderate)
- Deprecated API references still in tests
- Missing type hints in some test fixtures
- Inconsistent mocking patterns

## Next Session Priorities
1. Fix remaining test failures
2. Merge feature/us-047-architect-only-specs to roadmap
3. Consolidate and merge other ready branches
4. Address GitHub security vulnerabilities
5. Update CI/CD configuration for new test structure
