## Integration with ROADMAP

**How these findings become ROADMAP items**:

1. **Architect reviews** ANALYSIS_SUMMARY_2025-10-17.md
2. **Architect decides** refactoring scope (60h, 37h, or 17h)
3. **Architect creates** ROADMAP entries for Priority-1 items
4. **Code-developer** implements based on refactoring_priorities_2025-10-17.md specs
5. **Project-manager** tracks progress using metrics_baseline_2025-10-17.md
