# Command Consolidation Announcement

## Summary of Changes

MonolithicCoffeeMakerAgent has undergone a major architectural upgrade: **consolidating 100+ individual commands into 36 unified consolidated commands**.

This change improves:
- **Cognitive load**: Fewer commands to learn and remember
- **Consistency**: All commands use the same action-based routing pattern
- **Maintainability**: Fewer files, more focused implementations
- **Extensibility**: Easier to add new actions to existing commands

---

## What Changed?

### Before: 100+ Individual Commands

Each agent had many separate commands:

```
Project Manager (15 commands):
  - check_priority_status
  - get_priority_details
  - list_all_priorities
  - update_priority_metadata
  - check_dependency
  - add_dependency
  - ... and 9 more

Code Developer (14 commands):
  - claim_priority
  - load_spec
  - run_tests
  - fix_failing_tests
  - create_pull_request
  - ... and 9 more

Total: 100+ commands across all agents
```

### After: 36 Consolidated Commands

Each agent now has 3-6 focused commands:

```
Project Manager (5 commands):
  - roadmap(action="list" | "details" | "update" | "status")
  - status(action="developer" | "notifications" | "read")
  - dependencies(action="check" | "add" | "list")
  - github(action="monitor_pr" | "track_issue" | "sync")
  - stats(action="roadmap" | "feature" | "spec" | "audit")

Code Developer (6 commands):
  - implement(action="claim" | "load" | "update_status" | "record_commit" | "complete")
  - test(action="run" | "fix" | "coverage")
  - git(action="commit" | "push" | "create_pr")
  - review(action="request" | "status" | "feedback")
  - quality(action="check" | "lint" | "analyze")
  - config(action="update" | "validate" | "get")

Total: 36 commands across all agents
```

## How to Use Consolidated Commands

### Old Style (Still Works)

```python
# These still work (with deprecation warnings):
pm.check_priority_status("PRIORITY-28")
pm.get_priority_details("PRIORITY-28")
cd.claim_priority("PRIORITY-10")
cd.run_tests("tests/")
```

### New Style (Recommended)

```python
# New consolidated approach:
pm.roadmap(action="status", priority_id="PRIORITY-28")
pm.roadmap(action="details", priority_id="PRIORITY-28")
cd.implement(action="claim", priority_id="PRIORITY-10")
cd.test(action="run", path="tests/")
```

### Key Changes

1. **Action Parameter**: All commands use an `action` parameter to specify what to do
2. **Named Parameters**: Use named parameters instead of positional arguments
3. **Consistent Return Format**: All commands return `{success: bool, data: any, error: str}`

---

## Migration Timeline

### Phase 1: Compatibility Mode (Now - Nov 15)

- All old commands work via automatic aliasing
- Deprecation warnings guide to new commands
- Migration tools available

### Phase 2: Deprecation Phase (Nov 16 - Dec 15)

- Old commands still work but with prominent warnings
- Focus on migrating internal code
- Training on new consolidated commands

### Phase 3: Cleanup Phase (Dec 16+)

- Old command implementations removed
- Only consolidated commands available

---

## Architecture Changes

### Command File Structure

**Before**:
```
coffee_maker/commands/
  code_developer_commands.py      (46 KB, 14 functions)
  assistant_commands.py           (17 KB, 11 functions)
  user_listener_commands.py       (17 KB, 9 functions)
  ux_design_expert_commands.py    (22 KB, 10 functions)
  command_loader.py
  command.py
```

**After**:
```
coffee_maker/commands/
  consolidated/
    code_developer_commands.py    (8 KB, 6 methods)
    assistant_commands.py         (6 KB, 4 methods)
    user_listener_commands.py     (5 KB, 3 methods)
    ux_design_expert_commands.py  (5 KB, 3 methods)
    base_command.py
    compatibility.py              (handles legacy aliasing)
    migration.py                  (migration tools)
  command_loader.py
  command.py
```

### Code Organization

Each consolidated command class:
- Inherits from `ConsolidatedCommand` base class
- Uses `COMMANDS_INFO` to define available commands and actions
- Implements methods matching command names
- Uses `CompatibilityMixin` for backward compatibility

## Migration Guide

### Option 1: Automatic Migration

Use the migration tool to automatically update your code:

```python
from coffee_maker.commands.consolidated.migration import CodeMigrator

migrator = CodeMigrator("coffee_maker/")
migrator.migrate_all()
```

### Option 2: Manual Migration

Find and replace old commands:

```bash
# Find all old commands
grep -r "claim_priority\|run_tests\|create_pull_request" coffee_maker/

# Manual updates:
# cd.claim_priority("PRIORITY-10")
# becomes:
# cd.implement(action="claim", priority_id="PRIORITY-10")
```

### Option 3: Gradual Migration

Old commands still work! You can migrate gradually:

```python
# Week 1: Use old commands (with warnings)
pm.check_priority_status("PRIORITY-28")

# Week 2: Start using new commands alongside old
pm.roadmap(action="status", priority_id="PRIORITY-28")

# Week 3: Complete migration
# Only new commands in codebase
```

## FAQ

### Q: Do I have to update my code immediately?

**A**: No. Old commands continue to work with deprecation warnings. You can migrate gradually over the next 2-3 months.

### Q: What if I have custom commands?

**A**: The consolidated architecture supports adding new commands easily. Extend the `ConsolidatedCommand` base class and register your commands.

### Q: Will this break my integrations?

**A**: No. All old command APIs remain functional through compatibility aliases. The deprecation path ensures a smooth transition.

### Q: How do I handle the action-based routing?

**A**: It's simple. Instead of separate functions, pass the action as a parameter:

```python
# Old: cd.claim_priority("PRIORITY-10")
# New: cd.implement(action="claim", priority_id="PRIORITY-10")

# Old: cd.run_tests("tests/")
# New: cd.test(action="run", path="tests/")
```

### Q: Can I still use the old commands?

**A**: Yes, until phase 3 (Dec 15+). But you'll see deprecation warnings:

```
DeprecationWarning: claim_priority is deprecated.
Use implement(action="claim", priority_id="PRIORITY-10") instead.
```

## Technical Details

### Consolidated Command Base Class

```python
from coffee_maker.commands.consolidated import ConsolidatedCommand

class MyCommands(ConsolidatedCommand):
    COMMANDS_INFO = {
        "primary_command": {
            "description": "What this command does",
            "actions": ["action1", "action2"],
            "replaces": ["old_command1", "old_command2"]
        }
    }

    def primary_command(self, action: str, **params):
        if action == "action1":
            return self._action1(**params)
        elif action == "action2":
            return self._action2(**params)
        # ...
```

### Backward Compatibility

The `CompatibilityMixin` automatically creates aliases:

```python
class MyCommands(ConsolidatedCommand, CompatibilityMixin):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        self._setup_legacy_aliases("MY_AGENT")
        # Automatically creates:
        # - self.old_command1 = wrapper for primary_command(action="action1")
        # - self.old_command2 = wrapper for primary_command(action="action2")
```
