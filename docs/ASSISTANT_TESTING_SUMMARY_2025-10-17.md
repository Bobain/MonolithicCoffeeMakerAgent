    sound=False,
    agent_id="code_developer"
)
# Expected: Notification created successfully
# Actual: ✅ Notification ID: 191 created
```
- ✅ No exception raised
- ✅ Silent notification created
- ✅ Proper logging
- ✅ Works as designed

# Enforcement logic validated:
if sound and agent_id and agent_id != "user_listener":
    raise CFR009ViolationError(...)
```
- ✅ Logic correct and comprehensive
- ✅ Edge cases handled
- ✅ No bypass vulnerabilities

**Integration with daemon_spec_manager.py**:
Line 165-166 verified:

## System Integration Testing

### Cross-Feature Validation

**CFR-008 + CFR-009 Integration**:
When code_developer blocks on missing spec:
1. ✅ Blocking logic triggers (US-047)
2. ✅ Notification created (CFR-008 notification)
3. ✅ Notification uses sound=False (CFR-009 compliance)
4. ✅ agent_id="code_developer" set (CFR-009 tracking)
5. ✅ User receives error without interruption
6. ✅ All components work together seamlessly

**Daily Report Integration**:
1. ✅ dev-report command works independently
2. ✅ Works alongside daemon operations
3. ✅ No conflicts with notification system
4. ✅ Data remains consistent
5. ✅ Performance not impacted

**Notification System Stability**:
1. ✅ Multiple notification types working (error, info, question)
2. ✅ Priority levels correct (critical, high, normal, low)
3. ✅ Database operations consistent
4. ✅ No race conditions observed
5. ✅ Proper transaction handling
