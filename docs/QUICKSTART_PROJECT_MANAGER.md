# Project Manager - Quick Start Guide (5 minutes)

Get up and running with Coffee Maker's Project Manager CLI in just a few minutes.

## What is Project Manager?

**Project Manager** is a command-line tool that helps you manage your development roadmap, track progress, and communicate with the autonomous code developer daemon. Think of it as your AI project manager that keeps everything organized.

**Key Features:**
- üìã View and manage your ROADMAP.md
- üîî Handle notifications from the autonomous daemon
- ‚úÖ Approve/respond to implementation questions
- üìä Track development progress

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.11 or higher
- Poetry (Python package manager)
- Git repository with a ROADMAP.md file

## Installation

### Option 1: Development Setup (Recommended for Contributors)

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Bobain/MonolithicCoffeeMakerAgent.git
cd MonolithicCoffeeMakerAgent

# Install dependencies with Poetry
poetry install

# Activate the virtual environment
poetry shell

# Verify installation
project-manager --help
```

### Option 2: Direct Installation (Future - PyPI)

```bash
# Once published to PyPI (PRIORITY 3)
pip install coffee-maker

# Verify installation
project-manager --help
```

## Your First Command: View the Roadmap

Let's start by viewing your project roadmap:

```bash
# View the full roadmap (first 100 lines)
project-manager view
```

**Expected Output:**
```
================================================================================
Coffee Maker Agent - ROADMAP
================================================================================

# Coffee Maker Agent - Prioritized Roadmap

**Last Updated**: 2025-10-09
**Current Branch**: `feature/priority-2.5`
**Status**: PRIORITY 2-6 ‚úÖ 100% COMPLETE
...
```

### View a Specific Priority

```bash
# View just PRIORITY 1
project-manager view 1

# Or use the full name
project-manager view PRIORITY-2
```

## Check for Notifications

The autonomous daemon may ask questions or send updates. Check for notifications:

```bash
# List all pending notifications
project-manager notifications
```

**If you have notifications:**
```
================================================================================
Pending Notifications
================================================================================

‚ö†Ô∏è  HIGH:
  [5] PRIORITY 2.5: Needs Manual Review
      Claude API completed successfully but made no file changes.

      Possible actions:
      1. Review priority description - is it concrete enough?
      2. Manually implement this priority
      3. Mark as "Manual Only" in ROADMAP
      4. Skip and move to next priority

      Type: info | Created: 2025-10-09 19:08:30

Total: 1 pending notification(s)

Tip: Use 'project-manager respond <id> <response>' to respond
```

### Respond to a Notification

```bash
# Respond with approval
project-manager respond 5 approve

# Respond with custom message
project-manager respond 5 "Skip this priority and move to the next one"
```

## Run the Autonomous Daemon

Want the AI to implement features autonomously? Start the daemon:

```bash
# Set your Anthropic API key (required)
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY='your-api-key-here'

# Start the daemon in autonomous mode
python run_daemon.py --auto-approve
```

**The daemon will:**
1. Read ROADMAP.md to find the next planned priority
2. Use the Anthropic API to implement it
3. Create/modify files as needed
4. Commit changes to git
5. Create pull requests
6. Send you notifications for review

## Common Workflows

### Daily Check-In

```bash
# 1. Check notifications
project-manager notifications

# 2. View roadmap to see progress
project-manager view

# 3. Respond to any pending questions
project-manager respond <id> <your-response>
```

### Review Daemon Progress

```bash
# Check what the daemon is working on
project-manager view

# Look for priorities marked "üîÑ In Progress"
# Check git for recent commits
git log --oneline -10
```

### Troubleshooting

**Problem: "Command not found: project-manager"**
```bash
# Make sure you're in the poetry shell
poetry shell

# Verify installation
which project-manager
```

**Problem: "ROADMAP not found"**
```bash
# Make sure you're in the project root directory
cd /path/to/MonolithicCoffeeMakerAgent

# Verify ROADMAP.md exists
ls docs/ROADMAP.md
```

**Problem: "ANTHROPIC_API_KEY not set" (daemon)**
```bash
# Set the key in .env file (recommended)
echo "ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your-key-here" >> .env

# Or export it in your shell
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY='your-key-here'
```
