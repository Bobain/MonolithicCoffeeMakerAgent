# User-Listener Quick Start Guide

The **user-listener** is your primary interface to the MonolithicCoffeeMakerAgent team. It's an intelligent CLI that understands what you want to do and automatically routes you to the right agent.

---

## Getting Started (30 seconds)

### Step 1: Start the User-Listener

```bash
poetry run user-listener
```

You'll see:
```
User Listener Â· Primary Interface
Powered by Claude Haiku 4.5

I'm your interface to the agent team.
Tell me what you need, and I'll route it to the right specialist.
Type /exit or /quit to leave.

â€º
```

### Step 2: Type What You Want

Just type in natural language. The user-listener will figure out who should help:

```
â€º Show me the roadmap
```

The system automatically detects this is about roadmap/planning and routes to **project_manager**.

### Step 3: Read the Response

The right agent responds with expertise:
```
Project Manager: Here's the current roadmap...
[detailed roadmap information]
```

### Step 4: Exit When Done

```
â€º /exit
```

That's it! You're using the agent team.

## Common Tasks

### I want to ask about project status

```
â€º What's the current project status
â€º Show me the roadmap
â€º How many priorities are complete
â€º What's next on our list
```

**Routes to**: project_manager

**You get**: Strategic planning info, milestones, progress tracking

---

### I want to design something

```
â€º Design a caching layer
â€º What's the best architecture for authentication
â€º How should we structure the database
â€º Design pattern recommendation
```

**Routes to**: architect

**You get**: Technical specifications, design guidance, best practices

---

### I want to build something

```
â€º Implement the new feature
â€º Fix the authentication bug
â€º Write code for US-045
â€º Create a pull request
```

**Routes to**: code_developer

**You get**: Implementation guidance, code examples, development support

---

### I want a demo or explanation

```
â€º Create a demo for me
â€º Show me how the dashboard works
â€º Explain how this feature works
â€º Can you test this functionality
```

**Routes to**: assistant

**You get**: Visual demos, documentation, clear explanations, testing

---

### I want to analyze the code

```
â€º Where is authentication implemented
â€º Find where the API is defined
â€º Search for the database code
â€º Analyze the security
```

**Routes to**: assistant (with code analysis skills)

**You get**: Deep code analysis, patterns, dependencies, security review

---

### I want UI/UX help

```
â€º Improve the dashboard UI
â€º Design a better layout
â€º Make it look prettier with Tailwind
â€º What should the chart visualization show
```

**Routes to**: ux-design-expert

**You get**: Design guidance, Tailwind CSS expertise, visual recommendations

---

## How It Works

The user-listener uses a two-stage system to understand your request:

### Stage 1: Pattern Matching (Fast)
The system looks for keywords in your message:

- **"design"** â†’ architect
- **"roadmap"** â†’ project_manager
- **"implement"** â†’ code_developer
- **"demo"** â†’ assistant
- **"where is"** â†’ assistant (with code analysis skills)
- **"ui"** â†’ ux-design-expert

**Confidence**: 90% (very likely correct)

### Stage 2: AI Classification (Fallback)
If your request doesn't match any pattern, Claude Haiku 4.5 reads your message and figures out which agent makes sense.

**Confidence**: 50-80% (less certain, but adaptive)

**Threshold**: If confidence is below 80%, the user-listener handles it directly rather than routing.

## Tips & Tricks

### Be Specific
Instead of:
```
â€º Tell me about the project
```

Try:
```
â€º What's the current project roadmap
```
This matches the "roadmap" keyword â†’ routes correctly to project_manager

### Use Natural Language
You don't need to be formal. All of these work:

```
â€º Design a caching layer
â€º How should we cache things
â€º What's a good caching strategy
â€º Build a caching system
```

All route to architect because they contain "design" or similar keywords.

### Ask for What You Need
- Want demos? Ask assistant
- Want implementation? Ask code_developer
- Want architecture? Ask architect
- Want to understand code? Ask assistant (with code analysis skills)
- Want project info? Ask project_manager
- Want UI improvement? Ask ux-design-expert

### Multi-Turn Conversations
The user-listener remembers your conversation history:

```
â€º Design a caching system
[architect responds with design]

â€º Now implement it
[code_developer responds with implementation plan]

â€º Can you show me how to use it
[assistant responds with demo]
```

Each request is understood in context.

## Commands

| Command | Effect |
|---------|--------|
| `/exit` | Exit the user-listener |
| `/quit` | Exit the user-listener |
| Ctrl+C | Interrupt and exit gracefully |

---

## What If I Get the Wrong Agent?

Don't worry! If the user-listener routes your request to the wrong agent:

1. **The agent still tries to help** - Even if you get code_developer instead of assistant (with code analysis skills), the developer might still understand your question
2. **Ask more specifically** - Be more explicit about what you want:
   - Instead of: "Where is authentication"
   - Try: "Find where authentication is implemented in the code"
3. **Use the AI fallback** - If your request is ambiguous, the user-listener might handle it directly instead of routing, which can work too

## Common Questions

### Q: Can I run multiple user-listeners?

**A**: No, only one instance can run at a time. If you try to run a second one, you'll get an error:
```
Error: Agent 'user_listener' is already running! PID: 12345
```

Stop the first instance first:
```bash
pkill -f "user-listener"
```

### Q: Does it work offline?

**A**: No, the user-listener needs an API key to call Claude Haiku 4.5. The system checks for `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` in your `.env` file.

### Q: How long does it take to respond?

**A**:
- Pattern matching: < 100ms (very fast)
- AI routing/delegation: 1-2 seconds (reasonable)
- Getting specialized agent response: 5-30 seconds (depends on complexity)

### Q: Does it remember past conversations?

**A**: Yes! The user-listener loads your conversation history from previous sessions. You can reference things you discussed before.

### Q: Can I use it programmatically?

**A**: Currently, the user-listener is a CLI tool for manual interactions. Future versions might support API access or integration with other systems.

## Examples Walkthrough

### Example 1: Getting Project Status

```bash
$ poetry run user-listener

User Listener Â· Primary Interface
Powered by Claude Haiku 4.5

I'm your interface to the agent team.
Tell me what you need, and I'll route it to the right specialist.
Type /exit or /quit to leave.

â€º What's our project status

[system routes to project_manager]

Project Manager: Here's the current status:
  - 10 priorities completed
  - 3 priorities in progress
  - 5 priorities planned
  - Next milestone: End of October

Overall health: ðŸŸ¢ On track

â€º /exit

Goodbye!
```

### Example 2: Designing a Feature

```bash
â€º Design a user authentication system

[system routes to architect]

Architect: To design a user authentication system, consider:

1. **Architecture**:
   - Use JWT tokens for stateless auth
   - Store user credentials with bcrypt hashing
   - Implement OAuth2 for third-party integrations

2. **Security**:
   - Rate limiting on login attempts
   - Session timeout after 1 hour
   - HTTPS for all auth endpoints

3. **Best Practices**:
   - Never store passwords in plain text
   - Use CORS properly
   - Implement CSRF protection

Would you like me to create a technical spec for this?

â€º Yes please

Architect: Creating spec at: docs/architecture/specs/SPEC-011-authentication.md

â€º /exit
```

### Example 3: Multi-Agent Workflow

```bash
â€º Design and implement a caching layer

[system routes to architect for design]

Architect: I'm designing a caching layer...
[design response]

â€º Now implement it

[system routes to code_developer for implementation]

Code Developer: I'll implement the caching layer...
[implementation response]

â€º Create a demo

[system routes to assistant for demo]
