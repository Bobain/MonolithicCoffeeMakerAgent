## Risk Assessment

### Active Risks

#### Risk 1: Test Suite Pass Rate Unknown
- **Severity**: MEDIUM
- **Impact**: Unknown pass rate could hide regressions
- **Details**: 1809 tests collected successfully (1.71s), pass rate needs verification
- **Mitigation**:
  1. Run full pytest suite immediately
  2. Establish baseline metrics
  3. Fix any failures found
  4. Set up continuous test monitoring
- **Owner**: project_manager (verification), code_developer (fixes)
- **Timeline**: <1 day to verify
- **Status**: Actionable (test collection ✅, execution pending)

#### Risk 2: Open PR Backlog
- **Severity**: LOW-MEDIUM
- **Impact**: 9 open PRs could contain important fixes/features
- **Details**:
  - PR #129: US-047 (CFR-008 enforcement)
  - PR #128: PRIORITY 9 Phases 3-5
  - PR #127: US-045 Phase 1
  - PR #126: US-035 (Singleton enforcement)
  - PR #125: US-046 (user-listener UI)
  - 4 additional PRs
- **Mitigation**:
  1. Review and merge PRs systematically
  2. Prioritize by impact (CFR enforcement, critical features)
  3. Validate with test suite
- **Owner**: project_manager (coordination), architect (review)
- **Timeline**: 1-2 days
- **Status**: Manageable

#### Risk 3: Daemon Working on Legacy Priority
- **Severity**: LOW
- **Impact**: code_developer working on PRIORITY 9 (pre-Phase 0 work)
- **Context**: Phase 0 now complete, should move to Phase 1
- **Mitigation**:
  1. Let current work (PRIORITY 9) complete
  2. Update ROADMAP to prioritize Phase 1 (Orchestrator)
  3. Ensure daemon picks up Phase 1 next
- **Owner**: project_manager (ROADMAP update)
- **Timeline**: Current task completion + transition
- **Status**: Natural progression

### Resolved Risks (Last 7 Days)

   - Status: Agent count reduced 6 → 5, 50-150x faster code analysis

3. **Slow Spec Creation**: RESOLVED
   - Issue: architect taking 117 min/spec on average
   - Solution: spec-creation-automation skill (US-097)
   - Status: Spec creation 117 min → 25 min (78% improvement)

4. **Manual DoD Verification**: RESOLVED
