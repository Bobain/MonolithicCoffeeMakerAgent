## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

1. **Create Tasks**
   - Description: Users can create new tasks with title, description, category, priority, and due date
   - Priority: High
   - Acceptance Criteria:
     - Task created with all required fields
     - Validation prevents empty titles
     - Due date must be in the future
     - Category selected from predefined list
     - Priority set to Low/Medium/High

2. **Read Tasks**
   - Description: Users can view task lists and individual task details
   - Priority: High
   - Acceptance Criteria:
     - List all tasks with pagination (20 per page)
     - Filter by category, priority, status
     - Sort by due date, priority, created date
     - View single task with full details

3. **Update Tasks**
   - Description: Users can modify existing tasks
   - Priority: High
   - Acceptance Criteria:
     - Update any task field
     - Validation same as create
     - Track last modified timestamp
     - Prevent updating deleted tasks

4. **Delete Tasks**
   - Description: Users can soft-delete tasks
   - Priority: Medium
   - Acceptance Criteria:
     - Soft delete (mark as deleted, don't remove from DB)
     - Deleted tasks hidden from normal views
     - Permanent delete available to admins only
     - Undo delete within 30 days

### Non-Functional Requirements

1. **Performance**
   - List endpoint responds in < 200ms for 100 tasks
   - Database queries optimized with indexes
   - Target: 1000 concurrent users

2. **Security**
   - Tasks are user-scoped (users see only their tasks)
   - JWT authentication required for all endpoints
   - Input validation to prevent SQL injection/XSS

3. **Scalability**
   - Database schema supports millions of tasks
   - Pagination prevents loading all tasks at once
   - Expected load: 10,000 tasks per user

4. **Maintainability**
   - Code coverage: 90%
   - All public methods documented
   - Database migrations versioned

## Architecture

### Data Model

**Task Entity**:
- Fields:
  - `id`: UUID (primary key)
  - `user_id`: UUID (foreign key to users table, indexed)
  - `title`: String(200, not null)
  - `description`: Text (nullable)
  - `category`: Enum(Work, Personal, Shopping, Other)
  - `priority`: Enum(Low, Medium, High)
  - `status`: Enum(Todo, InProgress, Done)
  - `due_date`: DateTime (nullable, indexed)
  - `created_at`: DateTime (auto, indexed)
  - `updated_at`: DateTime (auto)
  - `deleted_at`: DateTime (nullable, soft delete)
- Relationships:
  - Many-to-one with User (user_id)
- Indexes:
  - user_id, created_at (for list queries)
  - user_id, due_date (for sorted views)
  - user_id, category (for filtering)
