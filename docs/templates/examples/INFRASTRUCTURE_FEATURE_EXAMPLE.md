5. Run unit tests (parallel)
6. Run integration tests
7. Generate coverage report
8. Upload coverage to Codecov
    ↓
If main branch:
9. Build Docker image
10. Deploy to staging
11. Run smoke tests
12. Notify team
    ↓
If tagged release:
13. Deploy to production
14. Run health checks
15. Notify team
```
