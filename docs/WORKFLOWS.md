# Development Workflows

This document contains detailed workflows for common development tasks in the MonolithicCoffeeMakerAgent project.

---

## 1. Implementing a New Priority

```bash
# 1. Check ROADMAP
cat docs/roadmap/ROADMAP.md

# 2. Create technical spec (if needed)
# Daemon uses: .claude/commands/create-technical-spec.md

# 3. Implement feature
# Daemon uses: .claude/commands/implement-feature.md or implement-documentation.md

# 4. Test and commit
pytest
git add .
git commit -m "feat: Implement PRIORITY X"
```

---

## 2. Adding a New Prompt

```bash
# 1. Create prompt file
cat > .claude/commands/my-new-prompt.md << 'EOF'
Do something with $VARIABLE_NAME.

Instructions:
- Step 1
- Step 2

Context:
$CONTEXT
EOF

# 2. Add to PromptNames
# Edit: coffee_maker/autonomous/prompt_loader.py
class PromptNames:
    MY_NEW_PROMPT = "my-new-prompt"

# 3. Use in code
prompt = load_prompt(PromptNames.MY_NEW_PROMPT, {
    "VARIABLE_NAME": value,
    "CONTEXT": context
})

# 4. Later: Sync to Langfuse (Phase 2)
# coffee_maker prompts sync
```

---

## 3. Using Puppeteer MCP

```bash
# In Claude Desktop, use browser automation:
"Navigate to https://example.com and take a screenshot"

# Or in code (future):
# result = await puppeteer_client.navigate("https://example.com")
# screenshot = await puppeteer_client.screenshot()
```

---

## 4. Git Tagging Workflow

See [GUIDELINE-004](architecture/guidelines/GUIDELINE-004-git-tagging-workflow.md) for complete details.

**Quick Reference**:

```bash
# code_developer: After completing implementation
pytest  # Ensure all tests pass
git add .
git commit -m "feat: Implement US-047 - Architect-only spec creation

ðŸ¤– Generated with [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code)

Co-Authored-By: Claude <noreply@anthropic.com>"
git tag -a wip-us-047 -m "US-047 implementation complete, awaiting DoD

Features:
- Architect-only spec creation
- User approval workflow
- Error handling improvements

Tests: All passing (23 tests)
Status: Awaiting DoD verification"
git push origin roadmap
git push origin wip-us-047

# project_manager: After DoD verification with Puppeteer
git tag -a dod-verified-us-047 -m "US-047 DoD verified with Puppeteer testing

Verification Steps:
- Tested spec creation workflow end-to-end âœ…
- Confirmed user approval process works âœ…
- Verified error handling scenarios âœ…

DoD Status: All criteria met

git push origin dod-verified-us-047

# project_manager: After multiple priorities complete
git tag -a stable-v1.3.0 -m "Release v1.3.0 - Architect Enablement

New Features:
- Architect-only spec creation (US-045, US-047) âœ…
- User approval workflow (US-046) âœ…
- Silent background agents (US-048) âœ…

Tests: 156 passing, 0 failing
DoD: All priorities verified

git push origin stable-v1.3.0
```

**Tag Types**:
- `wip-*`: code_developer marks implementation complete, tests passing
- `dod-verified-*`: project_manager marks DoD verified with Puppeteer
- `milestone-*`: Major features/epics complete
- `stable-v*.*.*`: Production-ready releases (semantic versioning)

## 5. Creating a POC for Complex Implementation

See [POC_CREATION_GUIDE.md](architecture/POC_CREATION_GUIDE.md) for complete details.

**When to use**: Complex features (>16 hours + High complexity) need validation before implementation

**Decision Matrix**:
- Effort >16h + Complexity HIGH â†’ **POC REQUIRED**
- Effort >16h + Complexity MEDIUM â†’ MAYBE (ask user)
- All other cases â†’ No POC

**Quick Workflow**:

```bash
# architect evaluates user story
# Decision: Effort = 84 hours, Complexity = HIGH (multi-process, IPC)
# â†’ POC REQUIRED

# 1. Create POC directory from template
cd docs/architecture/pocs/
cp -r POC-000-template/ POC-055-claude-skills-integration/
cd POC-055-claude-skills-integration/

# 2. Fill in README template
# - Update header (number, name, date, time budget: 20-30% of full = 17-25h)
# - List 3-5 concepts to prove
# - Define what's NOT in scope

# 3. Implement MINIMAL working code (20-30% scope)
# - Focus ONLY on proving core concepts
# - Skip error handling edge cases
# - Use print statements for logging (OK for POC)

# 4. Write basic tests
# - One test per concept
# - Just prove it works

# 5. Run and validate
python poc_component.py  # Should work!
python test_poc.py       # All tests pass!

# 6. Document learnings in README
# - What worked well
# - What needs adjustment
# - Recommendations for code_developer

# 7. Reference POC in technical spec
# Add to SPEC-055: "See POC-055 for proof-of-concept validation"

# 8. Commit to git
git add docs/architecture/pocs/POC-055-*/
git commit -m "feat: Add POC-055 - Claude Skills Integration

Proves Code Execution Tool integration, SkillLoader, ExecutionController work correctly.

Time: 4.5 hours (22% of 20-hour minimal scope)
Scope: 25% of SPEC-055

## 6. Dependency Management

See [SPEC-070](architecture/specs/SPEC-070-dependency-pre-approval-matrix.md) and [ADR-013](architecture/decisions/ADR-013-dependency-pre-approval-matrix.md) for complete details.

**Quick Check**:

```bash
# Check if package is pre-approved
poetry run project-manager check-dependency pytest-timeout
# â†’ âœ… pytest-timeout is PRE-APPROVED (version: >=2.0,<3.0)
```

**In Code**:

```python
from coffee_maker.utils.dependency_checker import DependencyChecker, ApprovalStatus

checker = DependencyChecker()
status = checker.get_approval_status("pytest-timeout")

if status == ApprovalStatus.PRE_APPROVED:
    # Auto-approve (2-5 min, NO user approval)
    subprocess.run(["poetry", "add", "pytest-timeout"])
    # Create minimal ADR (automated)

elif status == ApprovalStatus.NEEDS_REVIEW:
    # Delegate to architect for review (20-30 min)
    # architect uses dependency-conflict-resolver skill
    # User approval required

elif status == ApprovalStatus.BANNED:
    # Reject immediately with alternatives
    alternatives = checker.get_alternatives("pytest-timeout")
    print(f"Banned package. Use alternatives: {alternatives}")
```

## 7. Regular Refactoring and Technical Debt Reduction

See [US-044](roadmap/ROADMAP.md#us-044) and complete workflow guides in `docs/architecture/refactoring/` for details.

### Overview

architect monitors code quality weekly and creates refactoring plans for code_developer to execute.

### architect Weekly Monitoring (Monday 9am)

```bash
# Run complexity check
cd /Users/bobain/PycharmProjects/MonolithicCoffeeMakerAgent-wt044
./scripts/check_complexity.sh > docs/architecture/refactoring/weekly_$(date +%Y_%m_%d).txt

# Review output for issues
cat docs/architecture/refactoring/weekly_$(date +%Y_%m_%d).txt

# Look for:
# - Cyclomatic complexity >20 (Grade D-F)
# - Files >1500 lines
# - Pylint score <7.0
# - Test coverage <80%
```

### architect Creating Refactoring Plan

```bash
# If critical issues found, create refactoring plan
cp docs/architecture/refactoring/templates/REFACTOR_TEMPLATE.md \
   docs/architecture/refactoring/active/REFACTOR_$(date +%Y_%m_%d)_description.md

# Edit plan with:
# - Why refactor (metrics)
# - Current state (code examples)
# - Target state (desired structure)
# - Tasks for code_developer (specific, actionable)
# - Acceptance criteria (measurable)
# - Verification commands (exact commands to run)

# Example plan structure:
# 1. Why Refactor? - DevDaemon complexity 47 (Grade E)
# 2. Current State - 1592 lines, nested 4 levels deep
# 3. Target State - <500 lines, complexity <20
# 4. Tasks:
#    - Task 1: Extract SpecManagerMixin (4h)
#    - Task 2: Extract ImplementationMixin (4h)
#    - Task 3: Simplify main loop (3h)
# 5. Acceptance Criteria:
#    - Complexity <20 âœ“
#    - Lines <500 âœ“
#    - All tests passing âœ“
# 6. Verification:
#    - radon cc coffee_maker/autonomous/daemon.py -a
#    - pytest
```

### code_developer Executing Refactoring

```bash
# Find refactoring task
ls docs/architecture/refactoring/active/

# Read the plan
cat docs/architecture/refactoring/active/REFACTOR_2025_10_16_daemon_simplification.md

# Execute tasks one by one:

# Task 1: Extract SpecManagerMixin
touch coffee_maker/autonomous/mixins/spec_manager.py
# ... implement mixin
# ... update DevDaemon to inherit from mixin
pytest tests/unit/mixins/test_spec_manager.py -v
git add .
git commit -m "refactor: Extract SpecManagerMixin from DevDaemon

Part of REFACTOR-001 (Task 1/6)

ðŸ¤– Generated with [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code)

Co-Authored-By: Claude <noreply@anthropic.com>"

# Task 2: Extract ImplementationMixin
# ... repeat process

# After all tasks, run verification
radon cc coffee_maker/autonomous/daemon.py -a
# Expected: Complexity <20

wc -l coffee_maker/autonomous/daemon.py
# Expected: <500 lines

pytest
# Expected: All passing

pytest --cov=coffee_maker --cov-report=term
# Expected: >90% coverage
```

### architect Review Process (Friday 4pm)

```bash
# Run verification commands from plan
radon cc coffee_maker/autonomous/daemon.py -a
wc -l coffee_maker/autonomous/daemon.py
pytest
pytest --cov=coffee_maker --cov-report=term

# If all pass, approve and move to completed
mv docs/architecture/refactoring/active/REFACTOR_2025_10_16_daemon_simplification.md \
   docs/architecture/refactoring/completed/REFACTOR_2025_10_16_daemon_simplification_COMPLETED.md

# Update ROADMAP status to âœ… COMPLETE
```

### Decision Criteria

| Metric | Critical | High | Medium | OK |
|--------|----------|------|--------|----|
| Complexity | >40 | 30-40 | 20-30 | <20 |
| Lines | >2000 | 1500-2000 | 1000-1500 | <1000 |
| Pylint | <5.0 | 5.0-7.0 | 7.0-8.0 | >8.0 |
| Coverage | <70% | 70-80% | 80-90% | >90% |

**Action:**
- **Critical**: Refactor this week
- **High**: Plan refactoring within 2 weeks
- **Medium**: Refactor this month
- **OK**: No action needed
