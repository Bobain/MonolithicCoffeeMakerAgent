# Workflow Flaws - Executive Summary

**Date**: 2025-10-23
**Severity**: 🔴 **CRITICAL** - Roadmap progress at risk

---

## 🚨 Critical Issues Found

### 1. code_reviewer Writes to Files (Not Database)
**Location**: `coffee_maker/autonomous/code_reviewer.py:713, 943`

**Problem**: Review reports written to `docs/code-reviews/*.md` files instead of database

**Impact**:
- ❌ architect never notified of reviews
- ❌ No automated feedback loop
- ❌ Can't query reviews by spec
- ❌ Data inconsistency risk
- ❌ Breaks CFR-015 (database-only pattern)

**Fix**: Move review reports to database table

---

### 2. No Notification Processing Loop
**Location**: Missing entirely

**Problem**: Notifications pile up in `notifications` table but no one reads them

**Impact**:
- ❌ architect notifications never processed
- ❌ Spec links never created in roadmap
- ❌ Workflow completely stalled

**Fix**: Implement project_manager notification processor

---

### 3. No Implementation Complete Notification
**Location**: Missing from code_developer

**Problem**: When code_developer finishes work, no one is notified

**Impact**:
- ❌ Roadmap status never updates
- ❌ DoD verification never triggered
- ❌ Tasks stuck in "In Progress" forever

**Fix**: Add notification when implementation complete

---

## 📊 Potential Deadlock Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Spec Never Linked
```
architect creates SPEC-116
    ↓
Notification created ✅
    ↓
❌ NO ONE PROCESSES NOTIFICATION
    ↓
Roadmap item has spec_id = NULL
    ↓
code_developer can't find task
    ↓
🔴 DEADLOCK: Task never implemented
```

### Scenario 2: Reviews Never Read
```
code_developer implements feature
    ↓
code_reviewer finds issues
    ↓
❌ WRITES TO FILE (not database)
    ↓
❌ NO NOTIFICATION TO ARCHITECT
    ↓
Issues never addressed
    ↓
🔴 DEADLOCK: Bugs ship to production
```

### Scenario 3: Status Never Updates
```
code_developer completes work
    ↓
❌ NO COMPLETION NOTIFICATION
    ↓
Roadmap shows "In Progress"
    ↓
DoD verification never happens
    ↓
🔴 DEADLOCK: Task appears incomplete forever
```

## 🔧 Required Fixes (Priority Order)

### P0: Critical (Blocks All Progress)

1. **Add review_reports table**
   - Store reviews in database
   - Add architect notification trigger
   - File: `coffee_maker/autonomous/unified_database.py`
   - Effort: 2 hours

2. **Implement notification processor**
   - project_manager reads and processes notifications
   - Links specs to roadmap
   - Updates roadmap status
   - New file: `coffee_maker/autonomous/notification_processor.py`
   - Effort: 4 hours

3. **Add completion notification**
   - code_developer notifies when done
   - File: `coffee_maker/autonomous/code_developer.py`
   - Effort: 1 hour

### P1: High (Improves Reliability)

4. **Update code_reviewer to use database**
   - Stop writing files
   - Write to review_reports table
   - File: `coffee_maker/autonomous/code_reviewer.py`
   - Effort: 3 hours

5. **Add workflow orchestrator**
   - Daemon that processes notifications
   - Resets stale items
   - Detects stuck tasks
   - New file: `coffee_maker/orchestrator/workflow_daemon.py`
   - Effort: 6 hours

---

## 📈 Success Metrics

### Workflow is Fixed When:

- ✅ architect creates spec → roadmap updated within 5 minutes
- ✅ code_reviewer completes review → architect notified immediately
- ✅ code_developer completes work → roadmap status updates automatically
- ✅ No tasks stuck in wrong status for >24 hours
- ✅ All notifications processed within 5 minutes
- ✅ Zero file-based communications (database only)

## 🎯 Recommended Action Plan

### Week 1: Fix Critical Issues
- [ ] Day 1-2: Add review_reports table and migration
- [ ] Day 3-4: Implement notification processor
- [ ] Day 5: Add completion notifications and test end-to-end

### Week 2: Improve Reliability
- [ ] Day 1-2: Update code_reviewer to use database
- [ ] Day 3-4: Add workflow orchestrator daemon
- [ ] Day 5: Testing and documentation

### Week 3: Validation
- [ ] Day 1-2: Run full end-to-end workflow tests
- [ ] Day 3-4: Monitor production for issues
- [ ] Day 5: Final documentation and team training

## ⚠️ Risk Assessment

**If Not Fixed**:
- Roadmap will stall
- Specs created but never implemented
- Reviews written but never read
- Tasks stuck in wrong status
- No workflow automation possible
- Team productivity blocked

**Probability of Deadlock**: 🔴 **HIGH** (>80%)

**Recommended Action**: Start fixes immediately
