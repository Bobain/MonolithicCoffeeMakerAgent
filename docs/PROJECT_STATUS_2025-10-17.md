# Project Status Report - 2025-10-17

**Report Generated**: 2025-10-17 (Initial Check-In)
**Reporting Agent**: project_manager
**Report Type**: Honest Status Assessment

---

## CRITICAL FINDINGS

### Current Reality vs. Expected State

**Expected (from task description)**:
- 5 agents working in parallel
- code_developer fixing 37 test failures
- architect creating 6 refactoring specs
- assistant testing implementations
- code-searcher delivering analysis reports
- user_listener coordinating

**Actual Current State**:
- ‚ùå **ONLY code_developer is running** (PID 36258)
- ‚ùå **NO other agents are running**
- ‚ùå **code_developer is STUCK** in failure loop on PRIORITY 9
- ‚ùå **No visible progress in last several hours**

---

## Daemon Status

### code_developer (PID 36258)

**Status**: STUCK - Repeated Implementation Failures
**Current Task**: PRIORITY 9 - Enhanced Communication System
**Failure Count**: 7+ consecutive failures
**Last Activity**: 2025-10-16 22:13:30 (over 10 hours ago)

**Activity Log Summary**:
```
10:10 PM - Implementation failed
10:10 PM - Implementation failed
10:11 PM - Implementation failed
10:11 PM - Implementation failed
10:12 PM - Implementation failed
10:12 PM - Implementation failed
10:13 PM - Implementation failed
```

**Metrics**:
- Tasks completed today: 0
- Commits today: 0
- Tests passed today: 0
- Tests failed today: 0

**Diagnosis**: Daemon is in infinite failure loop, likely due to:
1. Missing technical specification details
2. Incompatible architecture approach
3. Code generation issues
4. Context overload (CFR-007 violation)

---

## Test Suite Status

**Collection Status**:
- ‚úÖ 1,641 tests collected successfully
- ‚ùå 3 test collection errors in deprecated modules

**Collection Errors**:
1. `test_auto_picker_llm.py` - Missing module `auto_picker_llm`
2. `test_context_length_management.py` - Missing module dependency
3. `test_cost_tracking.py` - Missing module dependency

**Recommendation**: Move deprecated tests to archive or fix imports

## Blocker Analysis

### BLOCKER #1: code_developer Stuck on PRIORITY 9

**Severity**: CRITICAL
**Impact**: All development stopped
**Duration**: 10+ hours

**Root Causes**:
1. Technical spec may be incomplete or incompatible
2. Implementation approach not working
3. Daemon lacks fallback mechanism
4. No human intervention for 10+ hours

**Immediate Action Required**:
1. Review PRIORITY 9 technical spec for completeness
2. Check if architect needs to revise architecture
3. Consider breaking PRIORITY 9 into smaller phases
4. Manual daemon restart may be needed

### BLOCKER #2: All PRs Failing CI

**Severity**: HIGH
**Impact**: No PRs can merge to main
**Count**: 9 PRs blocked

**Root Causes**:
1. Dependency review failures (likely new dependencies without approval)
2. Version check failures (version not incremented)
3. Test failures (various causes)

**Immediate Action Required**:
1. Fix version increment in pyproject.toml
2. Review and approve new dependencies
3. Fix failing unit tests
4. Address smoke test failures in PR #128 and #122

### BLOCKER #3: Test Collection Errors

**Severity**: MEDIUM
**Impact**: 3 test modules cannot run
**Files Affected**: 3 deprecated test files

**Immediate Action Required**:
1. Move deprecated tests to `tests/unit/_deprecated/_archived/`
2. OR fix import errors by restoring missing modules
3. Update test suite documentation

---

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions (Next 2 Hours)

1. **Unblock code_developer**:
   - Review PRIORITY 9 technical spec
   - Consider delegating to architect for spec revision
   - Manually restart daemon if needed
   - Break PRIORITY 9 into smaller, achievable phases

2. **Fix CI Failures**:
   - Increment version in pyproject.toml (PR-by-PR basis)
   - Review dependency changes for approval
   - Fix unit test failures in PR #129

3. **Clean Up Test Suite**:
   - Archive deprecated tests
   - Get test collection to 100% success

### Strategic Actions (Today)

1. **Activate Missing Agents**:
   - User task mentions 5 agents, but only code_developer is running
   - If architect is needed, user should invoke via user_listener
   - If assistant is needed for testing, user should invoke
   - If code-searcher analysis is needed, user should request

2. **Review and Prioritize PRs**:
   - Focus on getting 1-2 PRs merged first
   - Start with PR #129 (most recent, closest to passing)
   - Fix version + dependencies + tests
   - Merge to unblock further work

3. **ROADMAP Cleanup**:
   - Mark PRIORITY 9 status accurately (currently shows "Blocked by US-045")
   - Verify US-054 is properly added and prioritized
   - Update completion dates for recent work

---

## Next Steps

### For User

**Immediate Decision Needed**:
1. Should code_developer continue trying PRIORITY 9, or pivot to something else?
2. Should we break PRIORITY 9 into smaller phases?
3. Should architect revise the PRIORITY 9 spec?
4. Which PR should we focus on merging first?

**Agent Activation**:
- If you want architect to work on specs, invoke via user_listener
- If you want assistant to test features, invoke via user_listener
- If you want code-searcher analysis, request via user_listener
- If you want to coordinate all agents, use user_listener as the UI

### For project_manager (Me)

**Ongoing Responsibilities**:
- Monitor code_developer status every 30 minutes
- Update ROADMAP as work progresses
- Track PR status and CI health
- Warn user of critical blockers
- Provide progress reports

## Metrics Summary

**Development Velocity**:
- Commits today: 0
- PRs created today: 1 (PR #129)
- PRs merged today: 0
- Tests passing: 1,641 collected (some errors)

**Work In Progress**:
- Active priorities: 1 (PRIORITY 9 - stuck)
- Open PRs: 9
- Failing CI checks: 9/9 PRs

**Project Health**: üî¥ **CRITICAL** - Main development agent stuck for 10+ hours

---

## Conclusion

**Honest Assessment**: The project is currently BLOCKED. Despite the task description mentioning 5 agents working in parallel, the reality is that only code_developer is running, and it has been stuck in a failure loop for over 10 hours with no progress.

**User Decision Required**: Please provide direction on how to proceed. The autonomous system cannot unblock itself without either:
1. Manual intervention to fix the daemon
2. Architectural changes to PRIORITY 9 spec
3. Breaking PRIORITY 9 into smaller phases
4. Pivoting to a different priority

**My Role**: As project_manager, I will continue to monitor and report, but I cannot unblock code_developer without user guidance or architect intervention.

**Report End**
**Next Update**: After user provides direction
