# Performance Analysis - US-021 Phase 4

**Date**: 2025-10-16
**Scope**: Daemon hot path profiling and optimization opportunities

## Executive Summary

Profiled critical code paths in the autonomous daemon to identify performance bottlenecks.
Key finding: ROADMAP parsing is repeated unnecessarily on every iteration, reading a 746KB
file and parsing it completely even when no changes have occurred.

## Profiling Methodology

1. **cProfile** used for function-level timing analysis
2. **Multiple iterations** (10-100) to capture representative data
3. **Focused tests** on specific subsystems:
   - ROADMAP parsing (roadmap_parser.py)
   - Priority extraction
   - Status checking

## Top 5 Bottlenecks

### 1. ROADMAP File I/O

**Issue**: Reading entire ROADMAP.md file (746KB) on every iteration

**Impact**: High - Every daemon iteration pays this cost

**Proposed Solution**: Cache parsed roadmap, invalidate on file change (mtime/hash)

**Expected Improvement**:
- 50-80% reduction in parse time
- Eliminates redundant file I/O

---

### 2. String Operations

**Issue**: Content.split('\n') creates large list, multiple regex searches

**Impact**: Medium - Linear search through all lines repeatedly

**Proposed Solution**: Cache line splits, use compiled regex patterns

**Expected Improvement**:
- 10-20% improvement
- Reduces CPU overhead

---

### 3. Priority Extraction

**Issue**: Extract full section content for all priorities every time

**Impact**: Medium - Unnecessary when only checking status

**Proposed Solution**: Lazy load section content, cache priority metadata

**Expected Improvement**:
- 10-20% improvement
- Reduces CPU overhead

---

### 4. Regex Pattern Matching

**Issue**: Compiling regex patterns on every call

**Impact**: Low-Medium - Pattern compilation overhead

**Proposed Solution**: Pre-compile and cache regex patterns as class attributes

**Expected Improvement**:
- 10-20% improvement
- Reduces CPU overhead

---

### 5. Status Parsing

**Issue**: Linear search through 15 lines for each priority

**Impact**: Low - But adds up with many priorities

**Proposed Solution**: Optimize status extraction logic, early termination

**Expected Improvement**:
- 10-20% improvement
- Reduces CPU overhead

---

## Optimization Priorities

### High Priority (Immediate)
1. **ROADMAP Caching** - Biggest win, easiest to implement
   - Add file mtime/hash checking
   - Cache parsed priorities in memory
   - Invalidate cache only when file changes

### Medium Priority (Next Sprint)
2. **Regex Pre-compilation** - Quick win
3. **Lazy Loading** - Optimize priority content extraction

### Low Priority (Future)
4. **String Operations** - Optimize if still needed after caching
5. **Status Parsing** - Minor optimization

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: ROADMAP Caching (THIS PR)
- [x] Add CachedRoadmapParser class
- [x] Implement file mtime checking
- [x] Add cache invalidation logic
- [x] Update daemon to use cached parser
- [x] Benchmark improvements

### Phase 2: Regex Optimization (COMPLETED IN PHASE 1)
- [x] Pre-compile regex patterns (included in CachedRoadmapParser)
- [x] Cache compiled patterns
- [x] Measure improvement

### Phase 3: Import Optimization
- [x] Audit heavy imports
- [x] Use lazy imports where possible
- [x] Measure startup time improvement

## Benchmarking Results

### Before Optimization (Original RoadmapParser)
- ROADMAP parse time: 1.631s (100 iterations)
- Average per iteration: 16.31ms
- File I/O: 746.5KB read every iteration
- Priorities parsed: 14

### After Optimization (CachedRoadmapParser)
- ROADMAP parse time: 0.006s (100 iterations)
- Average per iteration: 0.06ms
- File I/O: 746.5KB read once, then cached
- Priorities parsed: 14 (from cache)

### Performance Improvement
- **Speedup**: 274.2x faster
- **Improvement**: 99.6% reduction in parse time
- **Time saved**: 16.25ms per iteration
- **Daily savings**: 0.8 minutes (daemon running 24/7 at 30s intervals)

## Conclusion

The profiling analysis identified ROADMAP parsing as the primary bottleneck. We implemented
a caching layer with file modification time (mtime) checking that provides dramatic
performance improvements while maintaining API compatibility.

### Key Achievements

1. **274x speedup** - Far exceeded the 50% improvement target
2. **99.6% reduction** in parse time - Nearly eliminated the bottleneck
3. **Intelligent caching** - Automatically detects file changes via mtime
4. **Zero breaking changes** - Same API as original parser
5. **Minimal code changes** - Single new file, drop-in replacement

### Impact on Daemon

For a daemon running 24/7 with 30-second check intervals:
- **Before**: 16.31ms per iteration spent parsing
- **After**: 0.06ms per iteration (cached)
- **Savings**: 16.25ms per iteration
- **Daily**: 0.8 minutes saved
- **Annual**: ~5 hours saved

### Technical Implementation

The `CachedRoadmapParser` class implements:
- File mtime checking for cache invalidation
- In-memory caching of parsed priorities
- Pre-compiled regex patterns (class-level)
- Cached line splits to avoid repeated string operations
- Lazy section content extraction (future optimization opportunity)

**Overall Impact**: Exceeded target - achieved 99.6% improvement vs. 50-70% expected.
