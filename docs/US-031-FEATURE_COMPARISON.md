#   -> CFRs: CFR-000 (Singleton), CFR-013 (Git)
```

---

### 3. Command Execution

- View command output
- Handle errors

#### MonolithicCoffeeMaker Enhancements
```bash
# Process monitoring
poetry run project-manager developer-status
# Shows:
# - Running processes (code_developer, orchestrator)
# - CPU/Memory usage
# - Current priority
# - Time elapsed

# Background daemon
poetry run code-developer --auto-approve
# Runs continuously in background
# Implements features autonomously
# Creates notifications for approvals
```

---

### 4. Git Integration

#### Claude CLI & Desktop
- Basic git operations

### 5. MCP Server Support

All three systems support MCP, but MonolithicCoffeeMaker has:

#### Puppeteer Integration
```bash
# Configuration: .claude/mcp/puppeteer.json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "puppeteer": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-puppeteer"]
    }
  }
}

# Used for DoD verification:
poetry run code-developer --auto-approve
# After implementing web feature:
# 1. Launches browser
# 2. Tests acceptance criteria
# 3. Takes screenshots
# 4. Verifies functionality
# 5. Marks priority complete
```

#### PuppeteerClient Utility
```python
from coffee_maker.autonomous.puppeteer_client import PuppeteerClient

# Generate verification prompt
prompt = PuppeteerClient.generate_verification_prompt(
    priority_number=25,
    acceptance_criteria=["Feature works", "No errors"]
)
```

### 6. AI Provider Support

#### Claude CLI & Desktop
- Claude only (Anthropic)
- Sonnet or Opus models
- API key required

#### MonolithicCoffeeMaker

**Multi-Provider Support** (PRIORITY 8 ✅):
```yaml
# config/ai_providers.yaml
providers:
  claude:
    enabled: true
    model: "claude-sonnet-4-5"
    cost_per_million_input: 3.0
    cost_per_million_output: 15.0

  openai:
    enabled: true
    model: "gpt-4-turbo"
    cost_per_million_input: 10.0
    cost_per_million_output: 30.0

  gemini:
    enabled: true
    model: "gemini-2.0-flash-exp"
    cost_per_million_input: 0.075
    cost_per_million_output: 0.3

fallback_strategy:
  enabled: true
  order: ["claude", "openai", "gemini"]
  max_retries: 3
```

**Usage**:
```bash
# Use specific provider
poetry run code-developer --provider gemini

# Automatic fallback on rate limits

# 10. Sleep, then repeat
```

#### Orchestrator (Parallel Execution)
```bash
# Run multiple priorities in parallel
poetry run orchestrator parallel-priorities 10 11 12

# Creates:
# - 3 git worktrees (roadmap-10, roadmap-11, roadmap-12)
# - 3 code_developer instances
# - Monitors all in SQLite database
# - Merges when complete
```

#### DoD Verification
```bash
# Automatic verification (US-032 ✅)

@observe(name="implement_priority")
def implement_priority(priority_id: str):
    # All agent actions tracked
    # Performance metrics
    # Cost tracking
    # Error rates
```

**Developer Status**:
```bash
poetry run project-manager developer-status
# Real-time dashboard:
