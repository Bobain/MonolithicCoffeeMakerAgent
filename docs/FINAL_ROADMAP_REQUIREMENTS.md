# Final Roadmap Requirements Summary

**Date**: 2025-10-09
**Status**: ✅ Complete - All requirements documented
**Total Updates**: 5 critical requirements added

---

## 📋 Summary of All Updates

### 1. ⚠️ Dependency Approval Requirement

**Location**: Recurring Best Practices → Section 9: Dependency Management

**Rule**: Daemon MUST ask user permission before installing ANY new dependency.

**6 Critical Reasons**:
1. 🔐 Security (malicious packages, supply chain attacks)
2. ⚖️ License Compliance (GPL violations)
3. 💰 Cost Management (API usage costs)
4. 📦 Codebase Bloat (unnecessary large dependencies)
5. 🔧 Maintenance Burden (more updates, breaking changes)
6. ⚠️ Version Conflicts (compatibility issues)

**Implementation**: `request_dependency_approval()` with 1-hour timeout

---

### 2. 🎯 Project Manager UI as PRIORITY 2

**Location**: Priority Reorganization section

**New Priority Order**:
1. 🤖 Autonomous Daemon (3-5 days)
2. 🎯 **Project Manager UI** (1-2 days) - **MOVED UP!**
3. 🗃️ Database Synchronization
4. 📊 Analytics & Observability
5. 📱 Streamlit Dashboards

**Why**: User needs single interface for:
- Viewing roadmap + daemon status
- Seeing pending notifications
- Responding to daemon questions
- Managing everything in one place

---

### 3. 📬 Notification System Design

**Location**: New document `docs/PRIORITY_2_NOTIFICATION_UI.md`

**Architecture**: File-based (no database initially)
- `data/notifications/pending/` - Daemon questions
- `data/notifications/responses/` - User answers
- `data/notifications/daemon_status.json` - Current state

**CLI**: `coffee-notify list`, `coffee-notify respond`, `coffee-notify status`

**Why Simple**: Get communication working immediately, database sync comes later

---

### 4. 🎬 Demo Requirement After Completion

**Location**: Recurring Best Practices → New section "Demo & Notification After Priority Completion"

**Rule**: After completing ANY PRIORITY, daemon MUST:
1. Create interactive demo (preferred) or documentation (minimum)
2. Notify user with demo link
3. Wait for user approval before starting next priority

**Demo Format**:
- **Option A (Preferred)**: Interactive demo (Python script, Jupyter notebook, video)
- **Option B (Minimum)**: Comprehensive documentation with examples

**Storage**: `demos/priority_X/README.md`, `demo.py`, screenshots

**Notification**: Sent through Project Manager UI with:
- Summary of what was built
- Link to demo
- Link to PR
- Statistics (files changed, tests passing)
- Next priority preview

**Checklist**:
```
- [ ] All features implemented
- [ ] All tests passing
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] Demo created ⚡ NEW
- [ ] User notified ⚡ NEW
- [ ] PR created
- [ ] ROADMAP.md updated
```

**If demo is missing**: PRIORITY is NOT complete!

---

### 5. 🌍 Future Vision: Universal Library

**Location**: Global Vision → Phase 2 section

**Transform into**: `roadmap-driven-dev` - Python library for ANY project

**Vision**: What we build for ourselves becomes product for thousands of developers

**Key Features** (Future):
- Language-agnostic (Python, TypeScript, Rust, Go, etc.)
- Codebase-aware (learns project patterns)
- Roadmap-driven (natural language → implementation)
- Human-in-the-loop (configurable supervision)

**Path**: 2025 Q1-Q4 milestones leading to public launch

## 🎯 Complete Daemon Workflow

With all requirements, daemon workflow is:

```
1. Read ROADMAP.md → Find next priority

2. Start implementation
   ↓
3. Need dependency? → Ask user permission (wait max 1h)
   ↓
4. Implement feature autonomously
   ↓
5. Run tests → Pass? Continue : Rollback
   ↓
6. Create demo (interactive script + documentation)
   ↓
7. Generate summary (files changed, tests, LOC)
   ↓
8. Create PR with demo link
   ↓
9. Notify user via Project Manager UI:
   "✅ PRIORITY X complete! 🎬 Demo: demos/priority_X/demo.py"
   ↓
10. Wait for user approval (max 24h)
    ↓
11. User response:
    - "approved" → Move to next priority
    - "changes requested" → Address feedback
    - timeout → Pause daemon
```

## 📊 Impact on Development Cycle

### Before (Manual Development)
```
Developer:
1. Read roadmap
2. Implement feature (days-weeks)
3. Test manually
4. Create PR
5. Maybe document it
6. Maybe create example

Time: Weeks per priority
Documentation: Often incomplete
Demos: Rarely created
```

### After (Autonomous Development)
```
Daemon:
1. Read roadmap ✅
2. Implement feature ✅
3. Run tests automatically ✅
4. Create PR ✅
5. Always document ✅
6. Always create interactive demo ✅
7. Notify user with demo link ✅

Developer (User):
1. Review PR (20-30 min)
2. Try demo hands-on
3. Approve or request changes
4. Merge when satisfied

Time: Days per priority (daemon works 24/7)
Documentation: Always complete
Demos: Always created
```

**Result**: 3-5x faster development with better quality!

## 🔐 Safety Guarantees

All requirements ensure safety:

1. **Dependency Approval** → No malicious packages
2. **Project Manager UI** → User always in control
3. **Demo Creation** → Validates features work end-to-end
4. **User Notification** → No surprises, full transparency
5. **Approval Gates** → Human oversight at key points

**Philosophy**: Autonomous but supervised, fast but safe
