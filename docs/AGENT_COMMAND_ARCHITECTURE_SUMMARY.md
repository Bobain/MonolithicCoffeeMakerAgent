# Agent Command Architecture - Implementation Summary

## Overview

We have successfully designed and begun implementing a comprehensive agent command extraction and database domain isolation architecture for the MonolithicCoffeeMaker system. This architecture transforms the current scattered, inline agent responsibilities into a structured, permission-enforced command system with clear data domain boundaries.

---

## What We've Accomplished

### 1. Complete Agent Responsibility Analysis ‚úÖ
- Analyzed all 8 agent prompts (architect, code_developer, project_manager, code_reviewer, orchestrator, assistant, user_listener, ux_design_expert)
- Extracted all responsibilities, actions, and data operations for each agent
- Created comprehensive responsibility matrix mapping agents to their data domains

### 2. Data Domain Architecture ‚úÖ
- Designed table prefix convention for domain isolation:
  - `arch_*` - Architect's domain (specs, ADRs, dependencies)
  - `dev_*` - Developer's domain (implementations, commits, tests)
  - `pm_*` - Project Manager's domain (roadmap, notifications, health)
  - `review_*` - Code Reviewer's domain (reports, scores, compliance)
  - `orch_*` - Orchestrator's domain (agent status, messages, health)
  - `assist_*` - Assistant's domain (demos, bug reports, delegations)
  - `user_*` - User Listener's domain (conversations, intents, sessions)
  - `ux_*` - UX Expert's domain (designs, components, tokens)
  - `shared_*` - Shared read-only data and audit trails

### 3. Command Structure Templates ‚úÖ
Created comprehensive command templates with:
- Metadata (agent, action, data domain)
- Input parameters with validation
- Database operations (READ/WRITE with SQL examples)
- Required skills mapping
- Detailed execution steps
- Error handling strategies
- Success criteria
- Example usage code

### 4. Database Access Layer Implementation ‚úÖ
Implemented `DomainDatabase` class with:
- **Permission enforcement**: Agents can only write to their domain tables
- **Read access control**: Controlled read permissions per agent type
- **Audit logging**: Every operation logged with agent identity
- **Cross-domain messaging**: Secure inter-agent communication via orchestrator
- **Context manager support**: Clean resource management
- **Comprehensive error handling**: Custom exceptions for access violations

### 5. Example Commands Created ‚úÖ
Created detailed command examples:
- **architect.create_spec**: Technical specification creation
- **code_developer.implement_priority**: Priority implementation
- **project_manager.update_roadmap**: Roadmap management

---

## Key Architecture Benefits

### 1. Security & Isolation
- **Write isolation**: Each agent can ONLY write to tables with their prefix
- **Read control**: Agents have limited, defined read access
- **Audit trail**: Complete history of who did what, when
- **No data corruption**: Agents cannot damage each other's data

### 2. Maintainability
- **Centralized commands**: All agent actions in `.claude/commands/agents/`
- **Self-documenting**: Commands include purpose, parameters, and examples
- **Version controlled**: Changes tracked in git
- **Easy updates**: Modify commands without changing core code

### 3. Observability
- **Full traceability**: Every action linked to command and agent
- **Performance metrics**: Track operation times per domain
- **Debug support**: Clear error messages with recovery suggestions
- **Health monitoring**: Track agent activity and system health

### 4. Scalability
- **Horizontal scaling**: Agents can run on different machines
- **Domain sharding**: Each domain could be separate database
- **Caching strategy**: Domain-specific optimization possible
- **Load distribution**: Route commands to available agents

## Migration Path

### Phase 1: Preparation
```python
# Create new unified database with all domain tables
python coffee_maker/database/create_schema.py

# Validate schema creation
python coffee_maker/database/validate_schema.py
```

### Phase 2: Data Migration
```python
# Migrate existing data to new schema
python coffee_maker/database/migrate_data.py

# Verify data integrity
python coffee_maker/database/verify_migration.py
```

### Phase 3: Agent Updates
```python
# Update each agent to use DomainDatabase
# Start with architect (least dependencies)
python coffee_maker/agents/update_architect.py

# Continue with other agents in order
python coffee_maker/agents/update_all.py
```

### Phase 4: Skill Updates
```python
# Update skills to use DomainDatabase
python coffee_maker/skills/update_skills.py
```

### Phase 5: Testing
```python
# Run comprehensive permission tests
pytest tests/test_domain_permissions.py

# Run integration tests
pytest tests/test_agent_commands.py
```

## Example: How It Works

### Before (Current System)
```python
# Inline, scattered database access
class ArchitectAgent:
    def create_spec(self, priority):
        # Direct database access - no permissions!
        conn = sqlite3.connect('data/specs.db')
        cursor = conn.cursor()
        cursor.execute("INSERT INTO specs ...")  # Can write anywhere!
```

### After (New System)
```python
# Domain-enforced, command-driven access
class ArchitectAgent:
    def __init__(self):
        self.db = DomainDatabase(AgentType.ARCHITECT)

    def create_spec(self, priority_id):
        # Load command definition
        command = load_command("architect.create_spec")

        # Permission enforced by DomainDatabase
        spec_id = self.db.write('arch_specs', {  # ‚úÖ Can write
            'priority_id': priority_id,
            'title': 'New Spec'
        })

        # This would fail with PermissionError
        # self.db.write('dev_implementations', {...})  # ‚ùå Cannot write!

        # Cross-domain communication via orchestrator
        self.db.cross_domain_notify('project_manager', {
            'type': 'spec_created',
            'spec_id': spec_id
        })
```

## Conclusion

This architecture provides a robust, scalable, and maintainable foundation for the MonolithicCoffeeMaker agent system. By extracting all agent responsibilities into discrete commands with enforced data domain boundaries, we achieve:

1. **Clear separation of concerns**: Each agent owns its data domain
2. **Enhanced security**: Permission enforcement prevents data corruption
3. **Better observability**: Complete audit trail of all operations
4. **Improved maintainability**: Centralized, self-documenting commands
5. **Future scalability**: Ready for distributed deployment

The implementation is well underway with core components completed. Following the migration plan will transform the system into a more robust, enterprise-ready architecture while maintaining all current functionality.
