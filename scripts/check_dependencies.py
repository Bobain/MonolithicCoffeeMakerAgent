"""Pre-commit hook to check for unapproved dependencies.

This script scans pyproject.toml for dependencies that are not in the
pre-approved list (SPEC-070). It blocks commits with unapproved dependencies
and provides guidance on the approval process.

Usage:
    # Run manually
    python scripts/check_dependencies.py

    # Run via pre-commit (automatically)
    git commit -m "Add dependency"
    # ‚Üí Pre-commit hook runs check_dependencies.py
    # ‚Üí Blocks commit if unapproved dependencies found

Exit Codes:
    0: All dependencies approved
    1: Unapproved dependencies found (blocks commit)

See: docs/architecture/specs/SPEC-070-dependency-pre-approval-matrix.md
