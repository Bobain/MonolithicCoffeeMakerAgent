While it creates notifications and commits, **users lack visibility into daily progress and overall status**:\n\n1. **Trust Building**: Users need to see what the AI developer accomplished each day\n2. **Progress Tracking**: Daily summaries help track momentum and identify blockers\n3. **Team Integration**: Professional developers provide standups - AI should too\n4. **Accountability**: Clear reporting of work done builds confidence in the system\n5. **Context Awareness**: Summaries help users understand where the project stands\n\n**Business Impact**: Daily communication transforms the daemon from a \"background process\" to a **trusted team member**, increasing user engagement and adoption.\n\n#### Project: Professional AI Developer Communication\n\n**Goal**: Make `code_developer` communicate progress, accomplishments, and status just like a professional human developer on an agile team.\n\n**Implementation Model**: The `project_manager` acts as the communication interface. When the user checks in (e.g., starts a new day with `project-manager chat`), the project manager **first reports what the code_developer accomplished** since the last check-in, then proceeds with the conversation.\n\n**Example Workflow**:\n```bash\n$ project-manager chat\n\n\ud83e\udd16 project-manager: Good morning! Before we start, here's what\n   code_developer accomplished yesterday:\n\n\ud83d\udcca Daily Update - 2025-10-09:\n\u2705 Completed PRIORITY 2.5 - Fixed daemon infinite loop\n   - Added retry limit tracking (3 attempts max)\n   - Created notification system for blocked priorities\n   - All tests passing | Coverage: 87% (+2%)\n   - Commits: 2 | PRs: 1\n\n\ud83d\udd04 Current Status:\n   - Working on PRIORITY 2.6 - CI Testing (50% complete)\n   - ETA: 2-3 hours remaining\n\n\u26a0\ufe0f Needs Your Attention:\n   - PRIORITY 2.5 documentation may need manual review\n   - Check notification #5 for details\n\nNow, how can I help you today?\n\n> _\n```\n\nThis creates a natural flow where the project manager keeps you informed about the developer's progress without requiring manual queries.\n\n**Smart Detection**: The project manager detects when it's a \"new day\" (first interaction after midnight or >12 hours since last chat) and automatically provides the daily summary before proceeding with the conversation.\n\n#### Core Features\n\n##### 1. Daily Standup Reports\n\n**Daily Summary Format** (Generated each morning at 9 AM local time):\n\n```markdown\n\ud83e\udd16 code_developer Daily Standup - 2025-10-10\n================================================\n\n\ud83d\udcca Yesterday's Accomplishments (2025-10-09):\n\u2705 Implemented PRIORITY 2.5 - New User Experience & Documentation\n   - Created docs/QUICKSTART.md (250 lines)\n   - Created docs/TROUBLESHOOTING.md (180 lines)\n   - Updated README.md with getting started guide\n   - Commits: 3 | Files changed: 5 | Lines added: 650\n\n\u2705 Fixed daemon infinite loop bug (Issue #42)\n   - Added retry limit tracking\n   - Created max_retries configuration\n   - Added notification system for manual review\n   - Commits: 2 | Tests: All passing\n\n\ud83d\udcdd Documentation & Maintenance:\n   - Updated ROADMAP.md with progress\n   - Reviewed and merged 2 pull requests\n   - Fixed 3 linting issues in analytics module\n\n\ud83d\udcc8 Metrics:\n   - Total commits: 5\n   - Total PRs created: 2\n   - Lines of code: +650 / -45\n   - Build status: \u2705 Passing\n   - Test coverage: 87% (+2%)\n\n\ud83d\udd04 Today's Plan (2025-10-10):\n1.
