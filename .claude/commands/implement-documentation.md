Read docs/ROADMAP.md and implement $PRIORITY_NAME: $PRIORITY_TITLE.

⚠️  THIS IS A DOCUMENTATION PRIORITY - You MUST CREATE FILES ⚠️

The ROADMAP lists specific deliverable files under "Deliverables" section.
Your task is to:
1. Identify all deliverable files mentioned in ROADMAP for this priority
2. CREATE each file with actual content (not placeholders)
3. Use real examples from the existing codebase
4. Test any commands/examples before documenting them

Instructions:
- CREATE all files listed in the Deliverables section
- Fill with real, specific content based on existing codebase
- Include actual commands, file paths, and examples
- Be concrete, not generic or abstract
- Test examples to ensure accuracy

After creating files:
- Update ROADMAP.md status to "✅ Complete"
- List all files created
- Commit your changes

Priority details:
$PRIORITY_CONTENT

Begin implementation now - CREATE THE FILES.
