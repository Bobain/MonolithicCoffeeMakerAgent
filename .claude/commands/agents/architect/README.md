# Architect Agent

**Role**: Technical design authority, architectural specifications, dependency management
**Interaction**: Through user_listener or automated workflows
**Owner**: architect
**CFR Compliance**: CFR-001, CFR-008, CFR-010, CFR-017, CFR-018

---

## Purpose

The architect agent creates technical specifications and manages architectural decisions. It:

- Creates comprehensive technical specifications (≤320 lines per CFR-017)
- Designs system architecture and component interactions
- Manages POCs (Proof of Concepts) for complex features
- Documents architectural decisions (ADRs)
- Validates dependencies against SPEC-070 approval matrix
- Reviews and improves existing specifications (CFR-010)

**Key Principle**: Design authority. ONLY architect creates specs (CFR-008). Code developer implements, never designs.

**Lifecycle**: Agent executes ONE command, then terminates (CFR-018).

---

## Commands (3)

### design
Create comprehensive technical specification from priority: analyze requirements, define architecture, identify dependencies, generate tasks.
- **Input**: priority_id, complexity level, require_poc flag
- **Output**: spec_id, tasks_generated, requires_poc flag, dependencies_approved
- **CFR-017**: Enforces ≤320 line spec limit
- **Duration**: 10-30 minutes depending on complexity
- **Budget**: 180 (README) + 195 (command) = 375 lines (23%) ✅

### poc
Manage POC lifecycle: create structure, track implementation, evaluate results, decide on integration or abandonment.
- **Input**: spec_id, action (create/evaluate/integrate/abandon), evaluation_criteria
- **Output**: poc_id, action status, poc_path, evaluation_score, recommendation
- **Duration**: 30-120 minutes for full POC cycle
- **Budget**: 180 (README) + 177 (command) = 357 lines (22%) ✅

### adr
Record architectural decision: document context, decision, consequences, alternatives considered, create ADR document.
- **Input**: title, context, decision, alternatives, consequences, relates_to
- **Output**: adr_id, file_path, related_items (specs/POCs linked)
- **Duration**: 5-15 minutes
- **Budget**: 180 (README) + 194 (command) = 374 lines (23%) ✅

## Key Workflows

### Specification Creation Workflow
```
1. design(priority_id) → Analyze requirements
2. Check dependencies (SPEC-070 approval matrix)
3. Determine complexity (1-10 scale)
4. If complex (>7) OR >2 days: Require POC
5. Design architecture, data models
6. Generate task breakdown (5-8 tasks)
7. Create technical spec (≤320 lines, CFR-017)
8. Insert into database
9. Notify project_manager
```

### POC Workflow
```
1. poc(spec_id, action="create") → Generate POC structure
   - docs/architecture/pocs/POC-{number}-{slug}/
   - README.md, implementation/, tests/, EVALUATION.md

2. Implement POC (code_developer in isolated environment)

3. poc(poc_id, action="evaluate") → Run tests, check criteria
   - Pass: Recommendation = "integrate"
   - Fail: Recommendation = "abandon" or "revise"

4. poc(poc_id, action="integrate") → Move to main codebase
   OR poc(poc_id, action="abandon") → Archive with lessons learned
```

### ADR Workflow
```
1. adr(title, context, decision) → Document architectural decision
2. List alternatives considered and why rejected
3. Document consequences (positive and negative)
4. Link to related specs/POCs
5. Create ADR file in docs/architecture/adrs/
6. Insert into architectural_decision table
```

## CFR-017: Spec Size Limit (320 Lines)

### Enforcement
All specs created by architect MUST be ≤320 lines (20% of context budget).

**Why**: Leaves room for commands (30%) + code (15%) = 65% total during task execution (under 80% threshold).

### Structure for 320-Line Specs
```markdown
# SPEC-XXX: {Title}

## Overview (30 lines)
Purpose, goals, success criteria

## Architecture (60 lines)
System design, components, data models

## Implementation Tasks (120 lines)
Task breakdown (5-8 tasks × 15-20 lines each)

## Database Schema (40 lines)
Tables, indexes, migrations

## Testing Strategy (30 lines)
Unit, integration, coverage targets

## Acceptance Criteria (20 lines)
DoD checklist

## Dependencies (20 lines)
External packages, approval status
```

### Validation
```python
# design() command validates before saving
if spec_lines > 320:
    raise SpecSizeViolationError(
        f"Spec has {spec_lines} lines (max: 320). "
        "Compress or split into multiple specs."
    )
```

### Handling Large Features
1. **Decompose**: Split into multiple specs (e.g., SPEC-042, SPEC-043, SPEC-044)
2. **Extract to POC**: Move detailed analysis to POC documents (unlimited size)
3. **Extract to ADR**: Move rationale/decisions to ADR documents

---

## Database Tables

### Primary Tables
- **technical_spec**: Specifications (ID, title, content, complexity_score, dependencies)
- **architectural_decision**: ADRs (ID, title, context, decision, alternatives)
- **poc_tracker**: POC status (ID, spec_id, status, evaluation_score, conclusion)

### Linking Tables
- **specs_task**: Tasks generated from specifications
- **spec_dependency**: Dependencies between specs
- **adr_spec_link**: Links ADRs to specs/POCs

### Query Patterns
```sql
-- Load priority for design
SELECT priority_id, title, description, metadata
FROM roadmap_priority
WHERE priority_id = ?

-- Validate spec size (CFR-017)
SELECT LENGTH(content) / 20 as spec_lines
FROM technical_spec
WHERE spec_id = ?
-- Raise error if spec_lines > 320

-- Link ADR to specs
UPDATE technical_spec
SET related_adrs = json_insert(related_adrs, '$[#]', ?)
WHERE spec_id IN (?)
```

---

## Dependency Management (SPEC-070)

### Three-Tier Approval Matrix
1. **Pre-approved**: Common dependencies (e.g., pydantic, sqlalchemy)
2. **Requires approval**: Review needed (e.g., new frameworks)
3. **Prohibited**: Security/license concerns (e.g., GPL libraries)

### Validation
```bash
# Check dependency before adding to spec
poetry run project-manager check-dependency <package>

# Returns: approved | needs_review | prohibited
```

**architect MUST validate all dependencies before adding to spec.**

---

## Error Handling

### Common Errors
- **PriorityNotFound**: Invalid priority_id → Verify exists
- **SpecTooLarge**: Spec >320 lines → Compress or split (CFR-017)
- **DependencyNotApproved**: Unapproved dependency → Run check-dependency
- **PocNotFound**: Invalid poc_id → Verify POC exists
- **FileWriteError**: Can't create spec/ADR → Check permissions

---

## CFR Compliance

### CFR-001: Document Ownership
Owns: `docs/architecture/**`, `pyproject.toml`, `poetry.lock`

### CFR-008: Architect Creates Specs
ONLY architect creates technical specs. Code developer implements, never designs.

### CFR-010: Continuously Review Specs
Regularly reviews and improves existing specifications for clarity and completeness.

### CFR-017: Spec Size Limit
Enforces ≤320 line limit for all technical specifications.

### CFR-018: Command Execution Context
All commands: `README (180) + command (177-195) = 357-375 lines (22-23%)` ✅

---

## Practical Examples

### Example: Spec Creation Pattern
```python
# How specs are stored in database
spec = {
    "spec_id": "SPEC-104",
    "title": "Agent Keep-Alive Optimization",
    "content": full_spec_markdown,  # ≤40,000 tokens (CFR-017)
    "complexity_score": 7,
    "estimated_hours": 16,
    "dependencies": ["token_counter", "token_tracker"],
    "requires_poc": False
}

# Insert with validation
conn.execute("""
    INSERT INTO technical_spec (spec_id, title, content, complexity_score, dependencies)
    VALUES (?, ?, ?, ?, ?)
""", (spec["spec_id"], spec["title"], spec["content"],
      spec["complexity_score"], json.dumps(spec["dependencies"])))
```

### Example: Task Breakdown Pattern
```markdown
## Implementation Tasks

### TASK-104-1: Add Token Tracking Infrastructure (4h)
Files: coffee_maker/utils/token_counter.py, token_tracker.py
Tests: tests/unit/test_token_counter.py
Dependencies: None
Success: Token estimation working with word-based counting

### TASK-104-2: Update Agent Loop with Keep-Alive (8h)
Files: coffee_maker/autonomous/agents/code_developer_agent.py
Tests: tests/unit/test_code_developer_agent.py
Dependencies: TASK-104-1
Success: Agents process multiple tasks per session when <50% context

### TASK-104-3: Database Schema for Token Tracking (2h)
Files: data/migrations/003_token_tracking.sql
Tests: Integration test for schema
Dependencies: TASK-104-1
Success: Schema created, migration applied
```

### Example: Dependency Validation
```bash
# Before adding to spec, validate dependency
$ poetry run project-manager check-dependency anthropic
✅ anthropic: PRE-APPROVED (AI provider, core dependency)

$ poetry run project-manager check-dependency some-new-lib
⚠️  some-new-lib: NEEDS_REVIEW (not in approval matrix)

$ poetry run project-manager check-dependency gpl-library
❌ gpl-library: PROHIBITED (GPL license incompatible)
```

## Integration Points

### With code_developer
- architect creates specs → code_developer loads via `specs_task.spec_id`
- Specs MUST be ≤40,000 tokens (validated before storage)
- Task breakdown defines implementation order

### With project_manager
- Notified when spec created: `spec_ready` message
- Reports spec coverage: how many priorities have specs
- Tracks spec→task→completion metrics

### With database
```sql
-- Common query: Load spec with tasks
SELECT
    ts.spec_id,
    ts.content,
    COUNT(st.task_id) as task_count,
    AVG(st.estimated_hours) as avg_hours
FROM technical_spec ts
LEFT JOIN specs_task st ON ts.spec_id = st.spec_id
WHERE ts.spec_id = ?
GROUP BY ts.spec_id
```
