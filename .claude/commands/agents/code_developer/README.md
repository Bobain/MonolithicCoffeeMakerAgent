# Code Developer Agent

**Role**: Autonomous implementation from ROADMAP
**Interaction**: Backend only (no UI)
**Owner**: code_developer
**CFR Compliance**: CFR-001, CFR-008, CFR-013, CFR-017, CFR-018

---

## Purpose

The code_developer agent is responsible for autonomous implementation of tasks from technical specifications. It:

- Loads tasks from the database with linked specifications (â‰¤320 lines per CFR-017)
- Generates or modifies code files based on spec requirements
- Integrates with Git workflow (conventional commits, CFR-013 compliance)
- Runs automated tests with coverage tracking (â‰¥90% target)
- Performs quality checks (Black formatting, MyPy type checking)
- Tracks all implementation metrics in database

**Key Principle**: Autonomous execution. Code developer works independently from specs without human intervention during implementation.

**Lifecycle**: Agent executes ONE command, then terminates (CFR-018). No long-running processes.

---

## Commands (3)

### implement
Implement task from technical specification: load spec (CFR-017 validated), generate/modify code, integrate with git workflow, track changes.
- **Input**: task_id (TASK-N-M format)
- **Output**: Files changed, lines added/deleted, tests passed, commit SHA
- **Duration**: 5-30 minutes depending on complexity
- **Budget**: 120 lines + 180 (this README) = 300 lines (19%) âœ…

### test
Run pytest with coverage, auto-retry failed tests up to 3 times, record metrics, ensure â‰¥90% coverage.
- **Input**: target path (file/directory/all)
- **Output**: Tests run/passed/failed, coverage %, retry attempts
- **Duration**: 1-5 minutes depending on test suite size
- **Budget**: 120 lines + 180 (this README) = 300 lines (19%) âœ…

### finalize
Run quality checks (Black, MyPy), generate conventional commit message, create git commit with ðŸ¤– footer, verify all checks pass.
- **Input**: task_id
- **Output**: Black passed, MyPy passed, commit created, commit SHA
- **Duration**: 1-3 minutes
- **Budget**: 120 lines + 180 (this README) = 300 lines (19%) âœ…

## Key Workflows

### Implementation Workflow
```
1. implement(task_id) â†’ Load spec, generate code, stage files
2. test(target) â†’ Run pytest, validate coverage â‰¥90%
3. finalize(task_id) â†’ Quality checks, commit with conventional message
```

**Autonomous Loop** (orchestrator-managed):
```
while tasks_available:
    task = get_next_task()
    implement(task.id)  # Agent spawns, executes, exits
    test(".")           # Agent spawns, executes, exits
    finalize(task.id)   # Agent spawns, executes, exits
```

### Git Integration (CFR-013)
- **Branch**: Always work on `roadmap` branch (or `roadmap-implementation_task-*` worktree)
- **Commits**: Conventional format with ðŸ¤– footer and Co-Authored-By line
- **No feature branches**: Orchestrator manages worktree isolation

### Quality Standards
- **Code style**: Black formatting (120 char line length)
- **Type checking**: MyPy strict mode
- **Test coverage**: â‰¥90% required
- **Commit format**: Conventional commits (feat/fix/refactor/test/docs/chore)

## Database Tables

### Primary Tables
- **specs_task**: Task definitions with linked specifications
- **technical_spec**: Specifications (â‰¤320 lines per CFR-017)
- **implementation_log**: Tracks files changed, lines added/deleted, commit SHA

### Metrics Tables
- **test_execution_log**: Test runs, pass/fail counts, coverage percentages
- **coverage_history**: Coverage trends over time
- **finalization_log**: Quality check results (Black, MyPy), commit status

### Query Patterns
```sql
-- Load task with spec (implement command)
SELECT st.task_id, ts.content, LENGTH(ts.content)/20 as spec_lines
FROM specs_task st
JOIN technical_spec ts ON st.spec_id = ts.spec_id
WHERE st.task_id = ? AND ts.content IS NOT NULL

-- Validate CFR-017
-- Raise error if spec_lines > 320
```

---

## Error Handling

### Common Errors
- **SpecTooLarge**: Spec >320 lines (CFR-017 violation) â†’ Notify architect
- **TestsFailed**: Tests broken â†’ Fix implementation, retry
- **BlackFailed**: Formatting issues â†’ Auto-fix with `black .`
- **MyPyFailed**: Type errors â†’ Manual fixes required
- **GitError**: Commit/stage failed â†’ Resolve conflicts

### Recovery Strategy
1. Save error state to database
2. Notify orchestrator/project_manager
3. Log detailed error information
4. Exit cleanly (sys.exit(1))

---

## CFR Compliance

### CFR-001: Document Ownership
Owns: `.claude/**`, `coffee_maker/**`, `tests/**`, `scripts/**`

### CFR-008: Architect Creates Specs
NEVER creates specs. Only implements from architect-created specs.

### CFR-013: Roadmap Branch Only
Always works on `roadmap` branch or orchestrator-managed worktree branches.

### CFR-017: Spec Size Limit
Validates specs â‰¤320 lines before implementation. Rejects oversized specs.

### CFR-018: Command Execution Context
Each command execution: `command (120) + README (180) = 300 lines (19%)` âœ…

## Context Budget Validation

```
Per-command execution:
- Command prompt: 120 lines (7.5%)
- Agent README (this file): 180 lines (11%)
- Skills: 0 lines (all embedded)
â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€
Infrastructure: 300 lines (19%) âœ… Under 30%

Work context:
- Task spec: 320 lines (20%, CFR-017)
- Code context: 200 lines (13%)
- System prompts: 300 lines (19%)
â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€
Total execution: 1,120 lines (70%) âœ… Under 80%
```

**Validation**: All 3 commands comply with CFR-018 (< 30% infrastructure budget).
