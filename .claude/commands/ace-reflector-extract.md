# ACE Reflector - Insight Extraction

You are extracting actionable insights from execution traces for the ACE (Agentic Context Engineering) framework.

Reference: https://www.arxiv.org/abs/2510.04618

## Your Task

Analyze execution traces and extract concrete, actionable insights that will improve agent performance.

## Input Parameters

You receive:
- `$TRACES` - JSON array of execution traces to analyze
- `$NUM_TRACES` - Number of traces provided
- `$AGENT_NAME` - Name of the agent being analyzed
- `$CURRENT_PLAYBOOK` - Current playbook/context for the agent (optional)

## Reflection Process

### Phase 1: Execution Analysis

For each execution trace, identify:

**What Worked (✓)**
- Which strategies led to success?
- Which context bullets were effectively applied?
- What reasoning patterns were sound?
- Which tools were used appropriately?

**What Failed (✗)**
- What caused errors or suboptimal results?
- Which context bullets were misleading or ignored?
- What reasoning was flawed?
- Were any tools misused or missing?

**Missing Elements (⚠)**
- What knowledge would have helped but wasn't in context?
- What failure modes weren't anticipated?
- What domain-specific concepts are needed?

### Phase 2: Pattern Recognition

Across all traces, identify:
- **Consistent behaviors** (good or bad)
- **Variance in strategy** and which approach was better
- **Systematic failure modes** that occur repeatedly
- **Tool usage patterns** (effective or problematic)
- **Context gaps** that cause confusion or errors

### Phase 3: Insight Distillation

Transform observations into concrete, actionable insights.

#### Good Insight Examples:
✓ "When processing financial data, always validate XBRL tags against the schema before extraction"
✓ "Use search_files tool before attempting code modifications to locate relevant modules"
✓ "For customer issues involving billing, prioritize checking payment history before suggesting solutions"

#### Bad Insight Examples (Too Generic):
✗ "Be careful when processing data"
✗ "Use tools appropriately"
✗ "Think before acting"

### Phase 4: Delta Generation

Create structured delta items in this format:

```json
{
  "delta_id": "unique_delta_identifier",
  "insight_type": "success_pattern|failure_mode|optimization|best_practice|tool_usage|domain_concept",
  "title": "Short descriptive title",
  "description": "Detailed explanation (1-3 sentences, concrete and specific)",
  "recommendation": "What to do (actionable)",
  "evidence": [
    {
      "trace_id": "trace_123",
      "execution_id": 1,
      "example": "Specific example from trace"
    },
    {
      "trace_id": "trace_123",
      "execution_id": 2,
      "example": "Specific example from trace"
    }
  ],
  "applicability": "When/where this insight should be applied",
  "priority": 1-5,
  "confidence": 0.0-1.0,
  "action": "add_new|update_existing|mark_harmful",
  "related_bullets": ["existing_bullet_id_1", "existing_bullet_id_2"]
}
```

## Insight Types

- **success_pattern**: Strategy that consistently leads to success
- **failure_mode**: Pattern that consistently leads to failure
- **optimization**: Way to improve efficiency or performance
- **best_practice**: General guideline for better outcomes
- **tool_usage**: Specific guidance on using tools effectively
- **domain_concept**: Domain knowledge that should be captured

## Priority Levels (1-5)

- **5 (Critical)**: Prevents failures, fixes major issues
- **4 (High)**: Significantly improves success rate
- **3 (Medium)**: Useful optimization or best practice
- **2 (Low)**: Minor improvement or edge case handling
- **1 (Nice-to-have)**: Informational or optional enhancement

## Confidence Levels (0.0-1.0)

- **0.9-1.0 (High)**: Observed in multiple traces, clear causal link
- **0.7-0.8 (Medium-High)**: Observed in multiple traces, plausible causal link
- **0.5-0.6 (Medium)**: Observed in one trace, clear causal link
- **0.3-0.4 (Low)**: Hypothesis based on limited evidence
- **0.0-0.2 (Very Low)**: Speculation, needs more validation

## Output Format

Save deltas to:
- Path: `docs/reflector/deltas/YYYY-MM-DD/deltas_<timestamp>.json`
- Format: JSON array of delta items
- Include: Metadata (agent_name, num_traces_analyzed, analysis_timestamp)

```json
{
  "metadata": {
    "agent_name": "$AGENT_NAME",
    "num_traces_analyzed": $NUM_TRACES,
    "analysis_timestamp": "ISO datetime",
    "reflector_version": "1.0"
  },
  "deltas": [
    {
      "delta_id": "...",
      "insight_type": "...",
      "...": "..."
    }
  ],
  "summary": {
    "total_deltas": 10,
    "by_type": {
      "success_pattern": 3,

      "optimization": 3,
      "best_practice": 2
    },
    "by_priority": {
      "5": 1,

    },
    "avg_confidence": 0.75

  "recommendations_for_curator": [
    "Consider consolidating deltas X and Y (semantic overlap)",
    "Delta Z conflicts with existing bullet B123 - investigate"
  ]
}
```

## Quality Guidelines

### DO ✓
- Be **specific and concrete**: Reference exact tools, files, patterns
- Provide **clear evidence**: Reference exact lines from execution traces
- Focus on **actionable insights**: Things that change behavior
- Maintain **appropriate scope**: Not too broad, not too narrow
- Consider **negative evidence**: What was tried but didn't work
- Identify **boundary conditions**: When does this insight apply?

### DON'T ✗
- Be vague: "Do things better"
- Make unsupported claims: "This always works"
- Generate redundant insights: Similar to existing bullets
- Over-generalize: "Never use this tool"
- Ignore context: Insights must fit agent's objective
- Skip evidence: Every insight needs proof

## Iterative Refinement

You can perform multiple refinement rounds:

**Round 1**: Initial insights extraction
**Round 2**: Refine language to be more precise and actionable
**Round 3**: Consolidate overlapping insights
**Round 4**: Prioritize the most impactful lessons
**Round 5**: Remove insights that are too vague or redundant

Example refinement progression:

**Round 1**: "Agent should check files before modifying"
**Round 2**: "Always use view tool to inspect file content before applying str_replace"
**Round 3**: "Before using str_replace on {file}, use view with view_range to confirm old_str exists exactly once in the target section"

## Success Criteria

A good reflection includes:
1. At least 3-5 actionable insights per trace analyzed
2. Concrete evidence from execution traces for each insight
3. Clear priority and confidence levels
4. Specific, not generic recommendations
5. Identification of both success patterns AND failure modes
