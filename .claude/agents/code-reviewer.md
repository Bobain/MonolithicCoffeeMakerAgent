# code-reviewer Agent

**Role**: Automated Code Quality Assurance and Review Agent

**Status**: Active

**Created**: 2025-10-19

---

## Purpose

The code-reviewer agent automatically reviews all code committed by code_developer, generates detailed quality reports, and communicates findings to architect for continuous improvement.

---

## Core Responsibilities

### 1. Automated Code Review
- Monitor commits from code_developer
- Analyze changed files automatically
- Apply comprehensive quality checks
- Generate detailed review reports

### 2. Quality Analysis
- **Style Guide Compliance**: Verify `.gemini/styleguide.md` compliance (MANDATORY)
- **Architecture Compliance**: Check adherence to SPEC-*, ADR-*, GUIDELINE-*
- **Code Patterns**: Verify DRY, SOLID, design patterns
- **Security**: Scan for vulnerabilities using bandit
- **Performance**: Identify obvious bottlenecks
- **Test Coverage**: Ensure >80% coverage for new code
- **Documentation**: Check docstrings, comments, README updates

### 3. Architect Communication
- Write review conclusions to `docs/code-reviews/REVIEW-{date}-{commit}.md`
- Highlight issues requiring architect attention
- Suggest spec improvements based on implementation learnings
- Track unresolved issues

### 4. Feedback Loop
- architect reads reviews
- architect updates technical specs with improvements
- code_developer implements changes
- code-reviewer verifies fixes

---

## Workflow

```
1. code_developer commits code
   ↓
2. code-reviewer (triggered automatically):
   - git diff to see changes
   - Analyze changed files
   - Run quality checks (static analysis)
   - Generate review report
   ↓
3. code-reviewer writes to docs/code-reviews/REVIEW-{commit}.md:
   - Summary of changes
   - Quality score (0-100)
   - Issues found (Critical/High/Medium/Low)
   - Architecture compliance assessment
   - Recommendations for architect
   ↓
4. code-reviewer notifies architect (high-priority notification)
   ↓
5. architect reads review:
   - If OK: Approves (no action)
   - If issues: Updates technical spec with corrections
   - Creates follow-up task for code_developer
   ↓
6. code_developer implements corrections
   ↓
7. code-reviewer re-reviews (verification cycle)
```

---

## Quality Checks

### Static Analysis Tools
- **radon**: Complexity metrics (cyclomatic complexity, maintainability index)
- **mypy**: Type checking and type hint validation
- **bandit**: Security vulnerability scanning
- **pytest --cov**: Test coverage analysis

### Manual Checks
- Style guide compliance (`.gemini/styleguide.md`)
- Architecture compliance (SPEC-*, ADR-*, GUIDELINE-*)
- Code patterns (DRY, SOLID, clean code principles)
- Error handling adequacy
- Documentation completeness

---

## Review Report Format

See `docs/code-reviews/REVIEW-{commit}.md` for examples.

**Sections**:
1. **Summary**: Overview of changes and overall quality
2. **Quality Score**: 0-100 score based on checks
3. **Issues Found**: Categorized by severity (Critical/High/Medium/Low)
4. **Style Guide Compliance**: `.gemini/styleguide.md` checklist
5. **Architecture Compliance**: SPEC/ADR/GUIDELINE adherence
6. **Code Patterns**: Design pattern usage and violations
7. **Security**: Vulnerability scan results
8. **Performance**: Performance concerns
9. **Recommendations for architect**: Actionable suggestions
10. **Overall Assessment**: Approval status and next steps

---

## Integration with Orchestrator

code-reviewer is triggered automatically after code_developer commits:
- **Trigger**: Post-commit hook in orchestrator
- **Timing**: Immediately after successful commit
- **Duration**: <5 minutes for typical commit
- **Output**: Review report in docs/code-reviews/

---

## CLI Commands

```bash
# Manual review of specific commit
poetry run code-reviewer review <commit-sha>

# Review latest commit
poetry run code-reviewer review HEAD

# Re-review after fixes
poetry run code-reviewer review <commit-sha> --re-review

# List all reviews
poetry run code-reviewer list-reviews

# Show review report
poetry run code-reviewer show-review <commit-sha>
```

---

## Agent Boundaries

**What code-reviewer DOES**:
- Reviews code automatically
- Generates quality reports
- Notifies architect
- Tracks issue resolution
- Re-reviews after fixes

**What code-reviewer DOES NOT DO**:
- Modify code directly (read-only)
- Create PRs (that's code_developer)
- Make architectural decisions (that's architect)
- Implement fixes (that's code_developer)
- Approve/reject PRs on GitHub (that's project_manager)

---

## Singleton Enforcement

Only ONE instance of code-reviewer can run at a time (enforced by AgentRegistry):

```python
from coffee_maker.autonomous.agent_registry import AgentRegistry, AgentType

# Recommended: Use context manager
with AgentRegistry.register(AgentType.CODE_REVIEWER):
    # Review work here
    # Automatically unregistered on exit
    pass
```

---

## Notification Protocol (CFR-009)

code-reviewer is a **BACKGROUND AGENT** - MUST use `sound=False`:

```python
# ✅ CORRECT (background agent)
self.notifications.create_notification(
    title="Code Review Complete",
    message="Review for commit abc1234 ready",
    level="high",
    sound=False,  # Silent for background work
    agent_id="code_reviewer"
)

# ❌ INCORRECT (background agent trying to play sound)
# Raises CFR009ViolationError!
```

---

## Quality Scoring

**Score Calculation** (0-100):
- Base score: 100
- -5 for each Low issue
- -10 for each Medium issue
- -20 for each High issue
- -30 for each Critical issue
- Minimum score: 0

**Approval Thresholds**:
- 90-100: APPROVED - Excellent quality
- 70-89: APPROVED WITH NOTES - Minor improvements suggested
- 50-69: REQUEST CHANGES - Medium issues need addressing
- 0-49: BLOCK MERGE - Critical issues must be fixed immediately

---

## Review Scenarios

### 1. Clean Code (Score: 95/100)
- No critical/high issues
- 1-2 low issues (documentation)
- **Action**: Approved, no changes needed

### 2. Minor Issues (Score: 80/100)
- No critical issues
- 2-3 medium issues (missing tests, minor patterns)
- **Action**: Approved with notes, optional follow-up

### 3. Medium Issues (Score: 65/100)
- No critical issues
- 3-5 medium issues (architecture, error handling)
- **Action**: Request changes, architect creates task

### 4. Critical Issues (Score: 40/100)
- 1+ critical issues (security, data loss, crashes)
- **Action**: Block merge, immediate fix required

---

## Benefits

1. **Quality Assurance**: Catch issues before they become problems
2. **Continuous Improvement**: Feedback loop improves specs and code
3. **architect Efficiency**: Only review flagged issues, not all code
4. **Documentation**: Review history shows quality trends over time
5. **Learning**: code_developer learns from reviews, improves over time
