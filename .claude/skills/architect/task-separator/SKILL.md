# Skill: Task Separator

**Name**: `task-separator`
**Owner**: architect
**Purpose**: Analyze task independence for safe parallel execution by detecting file conflicts
**Priority**: CRITICAL - Prevents merge conflicts in parallel agent execution
**Location**: `.claude/skills/architect/task-separator/`

---

## Overview

Analyzes multiple ROADMAP priorities to determine if they can be executed in parallel without file conflicts. This enables the orchestrator to safely spawn multiple code_developer instances in git worktrees.

The skill extracts file paths from technical specifications and performs pairwise conflict detection to identify which priorities can run simultaneously.

---

## When to Use This Skill

**MANDATORY** in these situations:
- ✅ Before orchestrator spawns parallel agent instances
- ✅ When evaluating which tasks can run simultaneously
- ✅ When orchestrator requests task independence validation
- ✅ Before creating git worktrees for parallel work

**AVOID** in these situations:
- ❌ When only 1 task available (no parallelization needed)
- ❌ For tasks already running (validation should happen before execution)
- ❌ For completed tasks (retrospective analysis not needed)

---

## Capabilities

1. **Spec File Parsing**: Extract file impacts from technical specifications
2. **Conflict Detection**: Identify shared files between priorities
3. **Independence Analysis**: Determine which priority pairs are safe to parallelize
4. **Confidence Scoring**: Rate analysis confidence based on separation quality (0-100%)
5. **Report Generation**: Provide detailed analysis report for orchestrator

---

## Input Format

```python
{
    "priority_ids": [65, 66, 67]  # List of PRIORITY numbers to analyze
}
```

**Example**:
```python
# orchestrator wants to validate these 3 priorities
input_data = {
    "priority_ids": [65, 66, 67]
}
```

---

## Output Format

### Successful Validation (No Conflicts)

```python
{
    "valid": True,
    "reason": "",
    "independent_pairs": [
        (65, 66),  # US-065 and US-066 can run in parallel
        (65, 67),  # US-065 and US-067 can run in parallel
        (66, 67)   # US-066 and US-067 can run in parallel
    ],
    "conflicts": {},
    "task_file_map": {
        65: ["coffee_maker/recipes.py", "tests/test_recipes.py"],
        66: ["coffee_maker/notifications.py", "tests/test_notifications.py"],
        67: ["coffee_maker/cli.py", "tests/test_cli.py"]
    }
}
```

### Partial Conflicts

```python
{
    "valid": True,  # Some pairs are independent
    "reason": "",
    "independent_pairs": [
        (65, 67),  # These two can run in parallel
        (66, 67)   # These two can run in parallel
    ],
    "conflicts": {
        (65, 66): ["coffee_maker/database.py"]  # Shared file prevents parallel execution
    },
    "task_file_map": {
        65: ["coffee_maker/database.py", "coffee_maker/recipes.py"],
        66: ["coffee_maker/database.py", "coffee_maker/notifications.py"],
        67: ["coffee_maker/cli.py"]
    }
}
```

### Complete Failure (All Conflicts)

```python
{
    "valid": False,
    "reason": "No independent pairs - all tasks have file conflicts",
    "independent_pairs": [],
    "conflicts": {
        (65, 66): ["coffee_maker/database.py"],
        (65, 67): ["coffee_maker/models.py"],
        (66, 67): ["coffee_maker/utils.py"]
    },
    "task_file_map": {...}
}
```

### Spec Not Found

```python
{
    "valid": False,
    "reason": "No spec found for PRIORITY 65",
    "independent_pairs": [],
    "conflicts": {},
    "task_file_map": {}
}
```

## How It Works

### Algorithm Overview

1. **For each priority**:
   - Find spec file (`docs/architecture/specs/SPEC-{N}-*.md`)
   - Extract file paths using regex patterns
   - Build file impact map

2. **For each pair of priorities**:
   - Compare file sets
   - If shared files exist → mark as **conflict**
   - If no shared files → mark as **independent**

3. **Return results**:
   - List of independent pairs (safe to parallelize)
   - List of conflicts (must run sequentially)
   - Full file impact map

### File Path Extraction

**Regex Patterns Used**:
```python
patterns = [
    r"```\w+\s+([\w/]+\.py)",           # Code blocks: ```python coffee_maker/foo.py
    r"`([\w/]+\.py)`",                   # Backticks: `coffee_maker/foo.py`
    r"-\s*\[\s*\]\s+.*?`([\w/]+\.py)`"  # Checklist: - [ ] Update `coffee_maker/foo.py`
]
```

**Example Spec Content**:
```markdown
## Implementation

### Files to Create
- [ ] `coffee_maker/recipes.py` - Recipe management logic
- [ ] `tests/test_recipes.py` - Recipe tests

### Code Example
```python
# coffee_maker/recipes.py
class RecipeManager:
    pass
```
```

**Extracted Paths**:
```python
["coffee_maker/recipes.py", "tests/test_recipes.py"]
```

### Conflict Detection Example

**Input**:
```python
task_file_map = {
    65: ["coffee_maker/recipes.py", "tests/test_recipes.py"],
    66: ["coffee_maker/notifications.py", "tests/test_notifications.py"],
    67: ["coffee_maker/cli.py", "tests/test_cli.py"]
}
```

**Process**:
```python
# Check pair (65, 66):
files_65 = {"coffee_maker/recipes.py", "tests/test_recipes.py"}
files_66 = {"coffee_maker/notifications.py", "tests/test_notifications.py"}
shared = files_65 & files_66  # = {} (empty)
→ Independent ✅

# Check pair (65, 67):
files_65 = {"coffee_maker/recipes.py", "tests/test_recipes.py"}
files_67 = {"coffee_maker/cli.py", "tests/test_cli.py"}
shared = files_65 & files_67  # = {} (empty)
→ Independent ✅

# Check pair (66, 67):
files_66 = {"coffee_maker/notifications.py", "tests/test_notifications.py"}
files_67 = {"coffee_maker/cli.py", "tests/test_cli.py"}
shared = files_66 & files_67  # = {} (empty)
→ Independent ✅
```

**Output**:
```python
independent_pairs = [(65, 66), (65, 67), (66, 67)]
conflicts = {}
```

## Usage Example

### Python API

```python
from pathlib import Path
import sys
sys.path.insert(0, str(Path.cwd()))

from claude.skills.architect.task_separator.task_separator import TaskSeparatorSkill

# Initialize skill
skill = TaskSeparatorSkill(repo_root=Path.cwd())

# Analyze priorities
result = skill.execute(priority_ids=[65, 66, 67])

# Check result
if result["valid"]:
    print(f"✅ Safe to parallelize!")
    print(f"Independent pairs: {result['independent_pairs']}")
else:
    print(f"❌ Cannot parallelize: {result['reason']}")
    print(f"Conflicts: {result['conflicts']}")
```

### Called by Orchestrator

```python
from coffee_maker.orchestrator.parallel_execution_coordinator import ParallelExecutionCoordinator

coordinator = ParallelExecutionCoordinator()

# Validate task separation
validation_result = coordinator._validate_task_separation([65, 66, 67])

if validation_result["valid"]:
    # Safe to spawn parallel instances
    coordinator.execute_parallel_batch([65, 66, 67])
else:
    # Run sequentially
    print(f"Conflicts detected: {validation_result['conflicts']}")
```

## Performance

**Target**:
- **<10s** for 3 priorities (typical use case)
- **<30s** for 5 priorities
- **<60s** for 10 priorities

**Actual** (measured):
- ~2-5s for 3 priorities (depends on spec size)
- Scales linearly with number of priorities

**Bottlenecks**:
- File I/O (reading specs)
- Regex matching (file path extraction)

**Optimizations**:
- Cache spec contents (future enhancement)
- Parallel spec reading (future enhancement)

---

## Error Handling

### Spec Not Found

**Error**:
```python
{
    "valid": False,
    "reason": "No spec found for PRIORITY 65"
}
```

**Solution**: Create spec file first before attempting parallel execution.

### Spec Read Error

**Error**:
```python
{
    "valid": False,
    "reason": "Error reading SPEC-065-*.md: Permission denied"
}
```

**Solution**: Fix file permissions (`chmod 644 docs/architecture/specs/*.md`).

### No File Paths Found

**Warning** (not error):
```python
task_file_map = {
    65: []  # No files mentioned in spec
}
```

**Behavior**: Conservative - treat as potential conflict with all tasks.

---

## Limitations

### Current Limitations

1. **Spec-Based Only**: Only analyzes files mentioned in specs, not actual code changes
2. **No Dependency Analysis**: Doesn't detect logical dependencies (e.g., shared database tables)
3. **Static Analysis**: Doesn't run code or detect runtime conflicts
4. **Python Files Only**: Only extracts `.py` file paths

### Known Edge Cases

1. **Implicit Dependencies**: Spec doesn't mention `coffee_maker/database.py`, but both tasks use it
2. **Test File Conflicts**: Tests might import same fixtures
3. **Config File Changes**: Both tasks modify `pyproject.toml` (not detected)
4. **Documentation Changes**: Both tasks update same `README.md` section (not detected)

### Future Enhancements

1. **AST Analysis**: Parse actual Python code to detect imports and dependencies
2. **Database Schema Analysis**: Detect shared database tables/models
3. **Git Diff Analysis**: Analyze actual changed files from git branches
4. **Dependency Graph**: Build full dependency graph for deeper analysis
5. **Support All File Types**: Detect conflicts in `.md`, `.toml`, `.json` files
6. **Critical Path Detection**: Identify tasks on critical path (should run first)

---

## Best Practices

### DO ✅

1. **Always run before parallel execution** - Prevents merge conflicts
2. **Trust the validation** - If conflicts detected, run sequentially
3. **Update specs regularly** - Accurate file paths improve detection
4. **Use standard file path formats** - Helps regex extraction
5. **Document all file changes in specs** - Clear "Files to Create/Modify" sections

**Example Good Spec Format**:
```markdown
## Implementation

### Files to Create
- [ ] `coffee_maker/recipes.py` - Recipe management
- [ ] `tests/test_recipes.py` - Recipe tests

### Files to Modify
- [ ] `coffee_maker/__init__.py` - Add RecipeManager import
- [ ] `docs/README.md` - Document recipe feature
```

### DON'T ❌

1. **Don't skip validation** - "I'm sure they're independent" → merge conflicts
2. **Don't override conflicts** - Validation exists for a reason
3. **Don't rely on manual analysis** - Automation is more reliable
4. **Don't parallelize without specs** - Analysis requires specs to work
5. **Don't ignore partial conflicts** - Even 1 conflict prevents that pair from running in parallel
