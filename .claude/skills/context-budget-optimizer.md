# Context Budget Optimizer Skill

## What This Skill Does

Detects when context exceeds 30% budget (CFR-007 compliance threshold), automatically prioritizes files, summarizes large documents, and provides optimized context loading guidance.

**Capabilities**:
- **Pre-flight Budget Checking**: Validates context size BEFORE loading files
- **Intelligent Summarization**: Auto-summarize long documents (70-80% compression)
- **Priority-Based File Selection**: Smart ranking by relevance to current task
- **Adaptive Context Splitting**: Break large tasks into manageable chunks
- **Context Budget Dashboard**: Real-time budget monitoring and recommendations

## When To Use

- **Before** loading large context files (ROADMAP, specs, etc.)
- When CFR-007 compliance warning appears
- Before starting complex multi-file tasks
- To understand current context budget usage
- When task is blocked by context size limitations

## Instructions

### Quick Start

```bash
python scripts/context_budget_optimizer.py analyze \
  --agent "architect" \
  --task "Create technical spec for US-055" \
  --files "docs/roadmap/ROADMAP.md,docs/architecture/SPEC-001.md,.claude/CLAUDE.md" \
  --budget-limit 60000
```

### Available Commands

#### 1. Analyze Context Budget
```bash
python scripts/context_budget_optimizer.py analyze \
  --agent "architect" \
  --task "Create technical spec" \
  --files "file1.md,file2.md,file3.md" \
  --budget-limit 60000
```

**Output**: Shows token count, budget usage %, recommendations

**Example Output**:
```
Context Budget Analysis
=======================

Agent: architect
Task: Create technical spec for US-055
Budget Limit: 60,000 tokens (30% of 200K)

Files to Load:
- docs/roadmap/ROADMAP.md: 28,144 lines = ~45,000 tokens
- .claude/CLAUDE.md: ~8,000 tokens
- docs/architecture/SPEC-001.md: ~15,000 tokens

ESTIMATED TOTAL: 68,000 tokens (113% - OVER BUDGET)

❌ BUDGET VIOLATION DETECTED

Recommended Optimizations:
1. Summarize ROADMAP.md (28,144 → 500 lines): -40,000 tokens (89% reduction)
   - Preserve: Acceptance criteria, next priorities, critical decisions
   - Output: data/summaries/ROADMAP_summary.md

2. Load CLAUDE.md partially (first 200 lines): -6,000 tokens (75% reduction)
   - Preserve: Core principles, agent ownership matrix
   - Omit: Historical context, deprecated features

3. Defer SPEC-001.md to follow-up task: -15,000 tokens
   - Reference instead: "See docs/architecture/SPEC-001.md for detailed API"

ADJUSTED TOTAL: 27,000 tokens (45% - WITHIN BUDGET ✅)

Files to Load:
✓ docs/roadmap/ROADMAP_summary.md (500 lines, summarized)
✓ .claude/CLAUDE.md (first 200 lines, partial)

Files to Omit (reference only):
- docs/architecture/SPEC-001.md (defer to task 2)
- docs/architecture/guidelines/ (not critical for spec creation)

Recommendation: ✅ Proceed with optimized file list
```

#### 2. Check Single File Size
```bash
python scripts/context_budget_optimizer.py check-file docs/roadmap/ROADMAP.md
```

**Output**: File size, estimated tokens, compression potential

#### 3. Estimate Task Context
```bash
python scripts/context_budget_optimizer.py estimate-task \
  --task "Implement US-055 feature" \
  --agent "code_developer"
```

**Output**: Typical context needs for this agent/task type

#### 4. Generate Summary
```bash
python scripts/context_budget_optimizer.py summarize docs/roadmap/ROADMAP.md \
  --target-lines 500 \
  --preserve-sections "Acceptance criteria,Critical decisions,Next priorities"
```

**Output**: Summarized version of file with preserved sections

#### 5. Dashboard
```bash
python scripts/context_budget_optimizer.py dashboard
```

**Output**: Real-time context budget metrics, trends, agent usage patterns

## Integration with Agents

### For architect Agent (Creating Technical Specs)

```python
# coffee_maker/autonomous/daemon_spec_manager.py

def _optimize_context_for_spec_creation(self, priority_name: str) -> dict:
    """Optimize context before creating technical spec."""
    from coffee_maker.autonomous.skill_loader import load_skill, SkillNames

    proposed_files = [
        "docs/roadmap/ROADMAP.md",
        ".claude/CLAUDE.md",
        "docs/architecture/SPEC-*.md",
        "coffee_maker/",  # code index
    ]

    skill = load_skill(SkillNames.CONTEXT_BUDGET_OPTIMIZER, {
        "AGENT": "architect",
        "TASK": f"Create technical spec for {priority_name}",
        "PROPOSED_FILES": ", ".join(proposed_files),
        "BUDGET_LIMIT": "60000",
    })

    # Execute with LLM
    from coffee_maker.autonomous.claude_cli_interface import ClaudeCLIInterface
    claude = ClaudeCLIInterface()
    result = claude.execute_prompt(skill)

    return {
        "status": "optimized",
        "recommendations": result.content if result else None
    }
```

### For code_developer Agent (Implementing Features)

```python
# coffee_maker/autonomous/daemon_implementation.py

def _optimize_context_for_implementation(self, priority_name: str) -> dict:
    """Optimize context before implementing priority."""
    from coffee_maker.autonomous.skill_loader import load_skill, SkillNames

    proposed_files = [
        "docs/roadmap/ROADMAP.md",
        ".claude/CLAUDE.md",
        "docs/architecture/specs/SPEC-*.md",
        "docs/architecture/guidelines/GUIDELINE-*.md",
        "coffee_maker/",  # code index
        "tests/",
    ]

    skill = load_skill(SkillNames.CONTEXT_BUDGET_OPTIMIZER, {
        "AGENT": "code_developer",
        "TASK": f"Implement {priority_name}",
        "PROPOSED_FILES": ", ".join(proposed_files),
        "BUDGET_LIMIT": "60000",
    })

    # Execute optimization
    ...
```

CFR-007 Threshold: 60,000 tokens (30%)
Current Usage: 68,000 tokens (34%)
Status: ❌ EXCEEDS THRESHOLD by 8,000 tokens

PROPOSED FILES (68,000 tokens)
==============================
1. docs/roadmap/ROADMAP.md                45,000 tokens
2. .claude/CLAUDE.md                       8,000 tokens

   TOTAL:                                 68,000 tokens

RECOMMENDED OPTIMIZATIONS (50,000 tokens total)
===============================================

Option A - Aggressive Summarization (27,000 tokens)
Priority: HIGHEST - Safe to execute immediately

1. Summarize ROADMAP.md:
   - Original: 28,144 lines = 45,000 tokens
   - Summarized: 500 lines = 1,200 tokens
   - Reduction: 43,800 tokens (97%)
   - Preserve: Current priorities, acceptance criteria, next tasks
   - Output: data/summaries/ROADMAP_2025-10-18.md
   - Confidence: HIGH

2. Load CLAUDE.md partially:
   - Load: First 200 lines (core principles, agent ownership)
   - Omit: Deprecated features, historical context
   - Reduction: 6,000 tokens (75%)
   - Confidence: MEDIUM

3. Defer SPEC-001.md:
   - Approach: Reference by name in spec, can load in follow-up task
   - Reduction: 15,000 tokens (100%)
   - Impact: May require follow-up task to reference
   - Confidence: HIGH

NEW TOTAL: 27,000 tokens (45% of budget) ✅ WITHIN LIMIT

Option B - Smart Prioritization (35,000 tokens)
Priority: MEDIUM - More context preserved

1. Load high-priority files only:
   - ROADMAP.md (current priorities): 8,000 tokens
   - CLAUDE.md (core only): 2,000 tokens
   - SPEC-055.md (target spec): 15,000 tokens

2. Omit low-priority files:
   - Historical ADRs: -10,000 tokens
   - Archived specs: -8,000 tokens

NEW TOTAL: 35,000 tokens (58% of budget) ✅ WITHIN LIMIT

RECOMMENDATION
===============
✅ Use Option A (Aggressive Summarization)
- Fastest execution (most context reduced)
- Summaries preserve all critical information
- Can execute immediately without task splitting

Proceed with:
✓ ROADMAP.md (summarized)
✓ CLAUDE.md (partial, first 200 lines)
✗ SPEC-001.md (defer to follow-up task)

Next Steps:
1. Run: python scripts/context_budget_optimizer.py summarize docs/roadmap/ROADMAP.md
2. Load optimized files into agent context
3. Proceed with task
4. After task 1, can create Task 2 for SPEC-001.md reference
