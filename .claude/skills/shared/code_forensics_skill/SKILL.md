# Code Forensics Skill

Code forensics analysis for assistant (with code analysis skills).

## Workflow

1. **Analyze Git History**: Parse git log for commits
2. **Identify Contributors**: Extract authors, commit counts, lines changed
3. **Detect Hotspots**: Find files changed most frequently
4. **Analyze Patterns**: Identify commit time patterns
5. **Generate Insights**: Extract meaningful insights
6. **Create Report**: Synthetic forensics report

## Expected Time Savings

- **Manual Forensics Analysis**: 1-2 hours
- **With Skill**: 10-15 minutes
- **Time Saved**: 85% reduction

## Use Cases

- **Onboarding**: "Who are the experts on this module?"
- **Code Review**: "What's the history of this file?"
- **Refactoring**: "Which files are changed most often?" (hotspots â†’ refactor targets)
