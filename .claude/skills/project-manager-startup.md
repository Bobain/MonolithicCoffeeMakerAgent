# Skill: Project Manager Agent Startup

**Name**: `project-manager-startup`
**Owner**: project_manager agent
**Purpose**: Intelligently load only necessary context for project_manager agent startup (solves CFR-007)
**Priority**: CRITICAL - Used at EVERY project_manager session start

---

## When to Use This Skill

**MANDATORY** at startup:
- ✅ **EVERY TIME** project_manager agent starts a new session
- ✅ Before reading any files
- ✅ Before responding to user queries

**Example Trigger**:
```python
# In project_manager agent startup sequence
startup_context = load_skill(SkillNames.PROJECT_MANAGER_STARTUP, {
    "TASK_TYPE": "roadmap_query",  # or "health_check", "pr_monitoring", "create_priority"
    "QUERY_CONTEXT": "What's the status of PRIORITY 10?",  # optional
})
```

---

## Skill Execution Steps

### Step 1: Identify Task Type

**Inputs Needed**:
- `$TASK_TYPE`: Type of task project_manager is starting
- `$QUERY_CONTEXT`: (Optional) User query or context

**Task Type Categories**:

1. **roadmap_query** - Answering questions about ROADMAP
   - Core role: ROADMAP navigator
   - Critical docs: ROADMAP.md (relevant sections), priority specs (if needed)
   - Optional: Related technical specs

2. **health_check** - Analyzing ROADMAP health
   - Core role: Project health monitor
   - Critical docs: ROADMAP.md (full), recent status reports
   - Optional: GitHub PR status, git commit history

3. **pr_monitoring** - Monitoring GitHub PRs
   - Core role: PR health monitor
   - Critical docs: GitHub PR data (via gh CLI)
   - Optional: ROADMAP (for priority context)

4. **create_priority** - Creating new ROADMAP priority
   - Core role: Strategic planner
   - Critical docs: ROADMAP.md (structure), recent priorities (for format)
   - Optional: User stories, business requirements

5. **update_roadmap** - Updating ROADMAP status
   - Core role: Status tracker
   - Critical docs: ROADMAP.md (priority section), priority spec (if exists)
   - Optional: Git commit history

6. **verify_dod_post** - Verifying DoD after implementation complete
   - Core role: Quality gatekeeper
   - Critical docs: Priority acceptance criteria, DoD report (from code_developer)
   - Optional: Puppeteer test results

---

### Step 2: Calculate Context Budget

**CFR-007 Requirement**: Agent core materials must fit in ≤30% of context window

**Context Window**: 200,000 tokens (Claude Sonnet 3.5 - project_manager uses Sonnet for analysis depth)
**Available for Core**: 60,000 tokens (30% budget)
**Available for Work**: 140,000 tokens (70% for analysis, responses)

**Token Estimation**:
```python
def estimate_tokens(text: str) -> int:
    """Estimate tokens (1 token ≈ 4 characters)."""
    return len(text) // 4
```

---

### Step 3: Load Core Role & Responsibilities (Always)

**ALWAYS load these files** (project_manager identity):

1. **`.claude/agents/project_manager.md`** (~3,500 tokens)
   - Role definition
   - Available skills (roadmap-health-check, pr-monitoring-analysis)
   - ROADMAP management responsibilities
   - Collaboration rules

2. **Key sections from `.claude/CLAUDE.md`** (~5,000 tokens) - **EXCERPTS ONLY**:
   - Agent tool ownership (what project_manager can modify: docs/roadmap/)
   - File ownership matrix (critical for understanding boundaries)
   - ROADMAP structure and conventions
   - GitHub integration (gh CLI usage)

**Total Core**: ~8,500 tokens (14% of budget) ✅

---

### Step 4: Load Task-Specific Context (Conditional)

#### For `roadmap_query`:

**Critical** (always load):
- **ROADMAP.md** (smart loading based on query) (~10,000 tokens)
  - If query about specific priority → Load that priority section only
  - If query about overall status → Load summary (priority list with statuses)
  - If query about dependencies → Load dependency graph section

**Example Smart Loading**:
```python
if "PRIORITY 10" in query:
    # Load only PRIORITY 10 section
    roadmap_section = extract_priority_section("PRIORITY 10", roadmap_md)
    tokens = ~2,000  # Just one priority
elif "status" in query or "progress" in query:
    # Load summary (all priorities with statuses, no details)
    roadmap_summary = extract_priority_statuses(roadmap_md)
    tokens = ~3,000  # Just status list
elif "dependencies" in query:
    # Load dependency relationships
    roadmap_deps = extract_dependencies(roadmap_md)
    tokens = ~4,000  # Dependency graph
else:
    # Load recent priorities (last 5)
    roadmap_recent = extract_recent_priorities(roadmap_md, n=5)
    tokens = ~8,000  # Recent context
```

**Optional** (load if budget allows):
- Priority spec (if query needs technical details) (~3,000 tokens)
- Related priorities (if query about dependencies) (~4,000 tokens)

**Total**: ~2,000-10,000 tokens (3-17% of budget, depending on query)
**Cumulative**: 10,500-18,500 tokens (18-31% of budget)

**Mitigation if over budget**:
- Use summary format for ROADMAP (statuses only, no descriptions)
- Defer technical specs to incremental reads

**Adjusted Cumulative**: 10,500-17,500 tokens (18-29% of budget) ✅

---

#### For `health_check`:

**Critical** (always load):
- **ROADMAP.md** (full or comprehensive summary) (~15,000 tokens)
  - All priorities with statuses
  - Recent completions (for velocity calculation)
  - Blockers and dependencies

**Note**: Health check needs broader context than query

**Mitigation**:
- Load as structured summary (not full text):
  ```
  PRIORITY 1: Analytics ✅ Complete (2025-10-12)
  PRIORITY 2: Project Manager CLI ✅ Complete (2025-10-13)
  PRIORITY 10: User Authentication 🔄 In Progress (started 2025-10-15)
  PRIORITY 11: Recipe Management 📝 Planned (blocked by: PRIORITY 10)
  ...
  ```
  This format: ~5,000 tokens (vs 15,000 for full text)

**Optional**:
- Recent status reports (for trend analysis) (~3,000 tokens)
- GitHub PR data (for integration with code velocity) (~2,000 tokens)

**Total**: ~10,000 tokens (17% of budget)
**Cumulative**: 18,500 tokens (31% of budget) ⚠️ **OVER CFR-007!**

**Mitigation**:
- Load ROADMAP as ultra-compact summary → 3,000 tokens
- Skip status reports (generate fresh analysis)
**Adjusted**: ~5,500 tokens (9% of budget)
**Adjusted Cumulative**: 14,000 tokens (23% of budget) ✅

---

#### For `pr_monitoring`:

**Critical** (always load):
- **GitHub PR data** (via gh CLI, not file read) (~4,000 tokens)
  - PR list with statuses
  - Failing checks
  - Review status
  - Note: This is fetched via Bash (gh pr list), not from files

**Optional**:
- ROADMAP context (to link PRs to priorities) (~2,000 tokens)
  - Which priority does each PR implement?
  - Are PRs for high-priority work or low?

**Total**: ~4,000 tokens (7% of budget)
**Cumulative**: 12,500 tokens (21% of budget) ✅

---

#### For `create_priority`:

**Critical** (always load):
- **ROADMAP.md** (structure and recent priorities) (~6,000 tokens)
  - Template format (how priorities are written)
  - Recent 3-5 priorities (for pattern matching)
  - Next priority number

- **Priority template** (if exists) (~1,500 tokens)
  - Standard priority format
  - Required sections

**Optional**:
- User stories (if provided by user)
- Business requirements

**Total**: ~7,500 tokens (13% of budget)
**Cumulative**: 16,000 tokens (27% of budget) ✅

---

#### For `update_roadmap`:

**Critical** (always load):
- **ROADMAP.md** (priority section being updated) (~2,000 tokens)
  - Just the specific priority
  - Dependencies (if any)

- **Priority spec** (if updating based on completion) (~3,000 tokens)
  - Verify what was implemented
  - Check DoD status

**Optional**:
- Git commit history (to verify work completed)

**Total**: ~5,000 tokens (8% of budget)
**Cumulative**: 13,500 tokens (23% of budget) ✅

---

#### For `verify_dod_post`:

**Critical** (always load):
- **Priority acceptance criteria** (~2,000 tokens)
  - From ROADMAP or spec
  - Expected outcomes

- **DoD report** (from code_developer) (~4,000 tokens)
  - Test results
  - Implementation summary
  - Evidence (screenshots, logs)

**Optional**:
- Puppeteer test script (if web feature)
- Manual verification checklist

**Total**: ~6,000 tokens (10% of budget)
**Cumulative**: 14,500 tokens (24% of budget) ✅

---

### Step 5: Load Skills (Context-Aware)

**Available Skills for project_manager**:
- `roadmap-health-check` - Use when `health_check` task
- `pr-monitoring-analysis` - Use when `pr_monitoring` task

**Conditional Loading**:
```python
if task_type == "health_check":
    skills_to_use = ["roadmap-health-check"]
elif task_type == "pr_monitoring":
    skills_to_use = ["pr-monitoring-analysis"]
else:
    skills_to_use = []
```

**Note**: Skills are **invoked during workflow**, not loaded into startup context.

---

### Step 6: Validate Context Budget (CFR-007)

**Validation Check**:
```python
def validate_cfr007(loaded_files: list[str]) -> dict:
    """Validate CFR-007 compliance."""
    total_tokens = sum(estimate_tokens(read_file(f)) for f in loaded_files)
    budget = 60000  # 30% of 200k

    return {
        "total_tokens": total_tokens,
        "budget": budget,
        "percentage": (total_tokens / 200000) * 100,
        "compliant": total_tokens <= budget,
        "remaining": budget - total_tokens
    }
```

**If over budget**:
1. **Smart ROADMAP loading**
   - Query-specific: Load only relevant sections
   - Health check: Use ultra-compact summary format
   - Create priority: Load template + recent 3 priorities only

2. **Defer non-critical context**
   - Technical specs: Load only if user asks for technical details
   - Historical data: Generate fresh analysis instead of loading old reports

3. **Use incremental loading**
   - Start minimal, read more files on-demand during conversation

---

### Step 7: Generate Startup Summary

**Create concise summary for project_manager**:

```markdown
# Project Manager Startup Summary

**Session Start**: 2025-10-18 11:00 AM
**Task Type**: roadmap_query
**Query Context**: "What's the status of PRIORITY 10?"

## Context Loaded (✅ CFR-007 Compliant: 21%)

### Core Identity (14%)
- ✅ Agent role & responsibilities
- ✅ Available skills (roadmap-health-check, pr-monitoring-analysis)
- ✅ ROADMAP management rules
- ✅ File ownership (docs/roadmap/)

### Task-Specific Context (7%)
- ✅ ROADMAP.md (PRIORITY 10 section only)
- ✅ Priority dependencies (PRIORITY 8, 9)

## Ready to Respond

**Available Context Budget**: 79% (158,000 tokens)

**Query Analysis**:
- User asking about: PRIORITY 10 status
- Relevant priority: PRIORITY 10 - User Authentication
- Current status: 🔄 In Progress
- Started: 2025-10-15
- Assigned to: code_developer
- Blocked by: None
- Blocking: PRIORITY 12 (User Dashboard)

**Recommended Response**:
"PRIORITY 10 (User Authentication) is currently In Progress. Started 3 days ago (2025-10-15), being implemented by code_developer. No blockers. Once complete, will unblock PRIORITY 12 (User Dashboard)."

**Next Steps**:
- If user asks for details → Load technical spec (SPEC-062)
- If user asks about velocity → Use roadmap-health-check skill
- If user asks about PRs → Use pr-monitoring-analysis skill
```

## Decision Logic: Which Files to Load

**Decision Tree**:
```
IF task_type == "roadmap_query":
    IF query about specific priority:
        Load: agent def, CLAUDE.md (excerpts), ROADMAP (priority section only)
    ELIF query about status/progress:
        Load: agent def, CLAUDE.md (excerpts), ROADMAP (summary format)
    ELIF query about dependencies:
        Load: agent def, CLAUDE.md (excerpts), ROADMAP (dependency graph)
    ELSE:
        Load: agent def, CLAUDE.md (excerpts), ROADMAP (recent 5 priorities)

ELIF task_type == "health_check":
    Load: agent def, CLAUDE.md (excerpts), ROADMAP (ultra-compact summary)
    Invoke: roadmap-health-check skill

ELIF task_type == "pr_monitoring":
    Load: agent def, CLAUDE.md (excerpts), GitHub PR data (via gh CLI)
    Invoke: pr-monitoring-analysis skill

ELIF task_type == "create_priority":
    Load: agent def, CLAUDE.md (excerpts), ROADMAP (template + recent 3)

ELIF task_type == "update_roadmap":
    Load: agent def, CLAUDE.md (excerpts), ROADMAP (priority section), priority spec

ELIF task_type == "verify_dod_post":
    Load: agent def, CLAUDE.md (excerpts), acceptance criteria, DoD report

ELSE:
    Load: agent def, CLAUDE.md (excerpts) only (minimal startup)
```

## Integration with Project Manager Agent

**In project_manager agent startup sequence**:

```python
# coffee_maker/autonomous/agents/project_manager_agent.py (future)

from coffee_maker.autonomous.skill_loader import load_skill, SkillNames

class ProjectManagerAgent:
    def __init__(self, task_type: str, query_context: str = None):
        # Step 1: Load startup skill
        self.startup_context = self._load_startup_context(task_type, query_context)

        # Step 2: Validate CFR-007
        if not self.startup_context["cfr007_compliant"]:
            self.startup_context = self._reduce_context_and_retry()

        # Step 3: Ready to respond
        self.ready = True

    def _load_startup_context(self, task_type: str, query_context: str = None):
        """Load context using project-manager-startup skill."""
        skill = load_skill(SkillNames.PROJECT_MANAGER_STARTUP, {
            "TASK_TYPE": task_type,
            "QUERY_CONTEXT": query_context or "",
        })

        # Execute skill with LLM
        from coffee_maker.autonomous.claude_cli_interface import ClaudeCLIInterface
        claude = ClaudeCLIInterface()
        result = claude.execute_prompt(skill)

        return self._parse_startup_result(result.content)
```
