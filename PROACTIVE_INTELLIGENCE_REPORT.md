## Summary

Successfully implemented a complete **Proactive Intelligence System** for the user_interpret agent, enabling it to be context-aware and proactive in conversations.

## User Requirement (Original)

> "the user_interpret should own some documents that accelerate and make his actions more accurate, one of these document should be dedicated to a critical feature: being able to be proactive in the discussion."

**Example**: "hey! here is a new feature you asked for: ... it is ready to be tested, the tutorial for you to test is available there: /docs/tuto ..."

## Example Workflows

### Workflow 1: Feature Request with Proactive Notification

**User**: "add authentication"

**user_interpret**:
- Logs conversation: `{"user_message": "add authentication", "intent": "add_feature", ...}`
- Creates request: `{"type": "feature", "status": "pending", "description": "add authentication"}`
- Delegates to code_developer

**code_developer** (completes work):
```python
agent.mark_request_completed(
    request_id="feature_20251015_103000",
    result_location="/docs/auth_tutorial.md"
)
```

**Next time user starts user_listener**:
```
‚ú® Hey! The feature you requested is ready: 'authentication'
   Check it out at: /docs/auth_tutorial.md
```

### Workflow 2: Contextual Suggestions

**User**: "what's the status?"

**user_listener** shows:
```
üí° I'm tracking 5 pending items. Want details on any specific request?
```

**User**: "show me the roadmap"

**user_listener** shows:
```
üìç Pro tip: You can also check real-time status with
   `poetry run project-manager developer-status`
```
