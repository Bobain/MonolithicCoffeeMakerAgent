ARCHITECTURE HIGHLIGHTS
================================================================================

✅ Unified Action-Based Routing Pattern
   - All commands use same pattern for consistency
   - action parameter specifies which operation to perform
   - Example: pm.roadmap(action="list", status="blocked")

✅ Comprehensive Error Handling
   - Parameter validation (required params, types, enums)
   - Database error handling with logging
   - Clear, actionable error messages
   - Graceful fallback behavior

✅ Command Metadata System
   - Each command class has COMMANDS_INFO dictionary
   - Documents actions, descriptions, and legacy command replacements
   - Enables introspection API (get_command_info, list_commands)

✅ Database Integration
   - All commands connected to SQLite database (data/roadmap.db)
   - Row factory for dictionary-like results
   - Configurable database path
   - Transaction support for data modifications

✅ Code Quality Standards
   - 100% type hints for all functions
   - 100% docstring coverage for public methods
   - Black formatter compliant (120 char lines)
   - Comprehensive logging throughout

✅ Backward Compatibility Ready
   - Designed for deprecation wrapper layer (Phase 2)
   - deprecated_command() factory method included in base class
   - Legacy command mapping documented in metadata

Phase 1 of the Consolidated Command Architecture implementation is complete and
ready for review. All 36 consolidated commands have been implemented across 8
agents, consolidating 91+ legacy commands into a unified, action-based API.

The implementation follows the specifications from the database, maintains 100%
code quality standards, and is prepared for Phase 2 (backward compatibility).

Status: READY FOR PHASE 2 ✅
