# BUG-066: ROADMAP parser inconsistency - agents use different parsers and miss user stories

**Status**: ðŸŸ¡ In Progress
**Priority**: Critical
**Created**: 2025-10-20T16:10:55.862779
**Reporter**: user_listener
**Assigned**: code_developer
**Category**: logic

## Description

Multiple ROADMAP parsers exist with different format support, causing agents to miss user stories.

## Reproduction Steps

1. Check parsers: grep -n 'pattern.*PRIORITY' coffee_maker/autonomous/roadmap_parser.py
2. Check ROADMAP formats: grep '^##[^#]' docs/roadmap/ROADMAP.md | head -5
3. Run parser test: python3 -c 'from coffee_maker.autonomous.roadmap_parser import RoadmapParser; p = RoadmapParser("docs/roadmap/ROADMAP.md"); print(len([x for x in p.get_priorities() if "US-110" in str(x)]))'
