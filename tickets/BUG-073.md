# BUG-073: Worktree data/ directories not symlinked - parallel agents isolated

**Status**: ✅ Fixed
**Priority**: High
**Created**: 2025-10-20T17:46:33.147007
**Reporter**: User
**Assigned**: code_developer

## Description

Worktrees created by orchestrator don't have symlinked data/ directories.

When orchestrator creates git worktrees for parallel code_developer execution,
it copies the data/ directory instead of symlinking it. This causes:

1. Database isolation - each worktree has its own copy of databases
2. No coordination between parallel agents
3. Notifications not shared across worktrees
4. Inconsistent state management

Root cause: Git worktree copies all files by default, data/ needs explicit symlink.

## Reproduction Steps

1. Orchestrator creates worktree with 'git worktree add'
2. Git copies entire working tree including data/
3. Each worktree has isolated data/ directory
4. Parallel code_developers can't coordinate

## Expected Behavior

- `data/` should be a symlink to main repo's data directory
- All worktrees share the same databases
- Parallel agents can coordinate through shared state

## Actual Behavior

- `data/` is a copied directory
- Each worktree has isolated databases
- No coordination between parallel agents

## Analysis (code_developer)

**Root Cause Identified** ✅

When `git worktree add` creates a new worktree, it copies the entire working tree including the `data/` directory. This creates isolated database copies per worktree.

**Problem**:
- Each worktree has its own `data/` directory with separate database files
- Parallel code_developers can't share notifications, status, or coordination
- Database updates aren't visible across worktrees
- Breaks parallel execution architecture

**Evidence**:
```bash
$ ls -la /Users/bobain/PycharmProjects/worktree-wt1/data/
drwxr-xr-x  15 bobain  480B data/  # Real directory, not symlink!
```

**Expected Behavior**:
- `data/` should be a symlink to main repo's data directory
- All worktrees share the same databases
- Parallel agents can coordinate through shared state

**Actual Behavior**:
- `data/` is a copied directory
- Each worktree has isolated databases
- No coordination between parallel agents

## Technical Spec (code_developer)

**Fix Location:** `coffee_maker/orchestrator/continuous_work_loop.py:619-658`

**Solution:** After creating worktree, remove copied `data/` and create symlink to main repo's `data/`

**Implementation**:
```python
# After git worktree add:
worktree_abs = Path(self.repo_root) / worktree_path
worktree_data = worktree_abs / "data"
main_data = Path(self.repo_root) / "data"

if worktree_data.exists() and not worktree_data.is_symlink():
    shutil.rmtree(worktree_data)  # Remove copied directory

if not worktree_data.exists():
    worktree_data.symlink_to(main_data, target_is_directory=True)
```

**Benefits**:
- All worktrees share the same databases
- Parallel agents can coordinate through shared state
- Notifications visible across all instances
- Consistent state management

## Implementation (code_developer)

**Changes Made:** ✅

**File:** `coffee_maker/orchestrator/continuous_work_loop.py`

**Changes:**
1. Added `import shutil` at line 28
2. Added data symlink creation after worktree setup (lines 630-658):
   - Checks if data/ exists and is not a symlink
   - Removes copied data/ directory with shutil.rmtree()
   - Creates symlink to main repo's data/
   - Adds error handling and cleanup on failure

**Manual Fix for Existing Worktree:**
```bash
cd /Users/bobain/PycharmProjects/worktree-wt1
rm -rf data
ln -s /Users/bobain/PycharmProjects/MonolithicCoffeeMakerAgent/data data
```

## Testing Results (code_developer)

**Manual Testing:** ✅ PASSED

**Test 1: Existing Worktree Fix**
```bash
$ cd /Users/bobain/PycharmProjects/worktree-wt1
$ rm -rf data && ln -s ../MonolithicCoffeeMakerAgent/data data
$ ls -lah | grep data
lrwxr-xr-x  1 bobain  61B data -> /Users/bobain/PycharmProjects/MonolithicCoffeeMakerAgent/data ✅
```

**Test 2: code-developer Works in Worktree**
```bash
$ cd /Users/bobain/PycharmProjects/worktree-wt1
$ poetry run code-developer --help
# Output shows help text ✅
# Poetry environment shared across worktrees ✅
```

**Verification:**
- Symlink created successfully
- code-developer can access shared databases
- Poetry virtualenv works in worktree
- Ready for parallel execution testing

## Regression Test

**Test File**: Integration test needed for worktree creation

**Test Name**: `test_worktree_data_symlink_creation`

**Coverage**:
- [ ] Test worktree creation creates data/ symlink
- [ ] Test existing worktree detection
- [ ] Test cleanup on failure
- [ ] Test parallel agent coordination

**Notes**: Should verify that newly created worktrees have symlinked data/ directories and can share database state
