# BUG-001: Daemon Stuck at Iteration 2 Without --auto-approve

**Status**: ðŸ”´ Open
**Priority**: ðŸš¨ URGENT
**Created**: 2025-10-11T12:25:00

## Description

The currently running daemon (PID 78575) is stuck at iteration 2 and not making progress on PRIORITY 2.8. Investigation revealed the daemon was started without the `--auto-approve` flag, causing it to wait for manual approval instead of running autonomously.

## Reproduction Steps

1. Check current daemon status: `cat ~/.coffee_maker/daemon_status.json`
2. Observe: iteration count stuck at 2 for over 30 minutes
3. Check process command line: `ps aux | grep 78575`
4. Observe: No `--auto-approve` flag in command

## Expected Behavior

- Daemon should be running with `--auto-approve` flag for autonomous operation
- Daemon should make continuous progress through iterations
- Progress should be visible via `/status` command in project-manager

## Actual Behavior

- Daemon running WITHOUT `--auto-approve` flag
- Stuck at iteration 2 for extended period
- Not making autonomous progress on PRIORITY 2.8
- Waiting for manual approval that will never come

## Root Cause (Identified)

The fix was already implemented in commit 491a438:
- ProcessManager.start_daemon() now includes `--auto-approve` flag
- Process detection updated to require `--auto-approve` flag

However, the **currently running daemon** (PID 78575) was started with the OLD code and needs to be restarted.

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Stop currently running daemon (PID 78575)
- [ ] Verify old daemon stopped cleanly
- [ ] Start new daemon with fixed ProcessManager (includes --auto-approve)
- [ ] Verify new daemon has --auto-approve in process command line
- [ ] Monitor for 5-10 minutes to ensure progress (iteration count increases)
- [ ] Verify via `/status` that daemon is making progress
- [ ] Update ROADMAP.md to mark this bug as resolved
- [ ] Document lesson learned to prevent similar issues

## Impact

**CRITICAL**: Without fixing this, the autonomous daemon is completely non-functional:
- User thinks daemon is working but it's stuck
- No progress on roadmap priorities
- False sense of automation
- Wastes development time

## Technical Details

**Old daemon (stuck)**:
- PID: 78575
- Started: 2025-10-11T11:42:39
- Command: Does NOT include --auto-approve
- Status: Stuck at iteration 2

**Fix implemented**:
- Commit: 491a438
- File: coffee_maker/process_manager.py
- Change: Added --auto-approve to start_daemon() command

**Required action**: Restart daemon to pick up the fix

**User Request**: "please make it a bug to be fixed quickly"

**Urgency**: This bug blocks all autonomous development work and should be fixed immediately.
