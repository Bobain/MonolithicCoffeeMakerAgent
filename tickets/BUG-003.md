# BUG-003: Architect failing on spec tasks

**Status**: ðŸ”´ Open
**Priority**: High
**Created**: 2025-10-21T16:44:07.163727
**Reporter**: orchestrator
**Assigned**: architect
**Category**: architect_failure

## Description

Detected 18 repeated failures of architect in the last 30 minutes.

**Pattern**: architect spawns and exits immediately (NO EXIT CODE) without completing work.
**Task Pattern**: spec-* tasks
**Example Task**: spec-031
**Last Occurrence**: 2025-10-21T16:02:49.292851

**Likely Root Causes**:
1. Missing LLM configuration (for architect/code-reviewer agents)
2. Missing environment variables
3. Configuration file issues
4. Dependency conflicts

**Recommended Investigation**:
1. Check agent logs for error messages
2. Verify .env file exists and has correct API keys
3. Test agent manually: `poetry run architect --help`
4. Check database for error patterns


## Reproduction Steps

1. 1. Start orchestrator: `poetry run orchestrator start`
2. 2. Observe architect spawning for spec tasks
3. 3. Agent exits immediately without work completion
4. 4. Pattern repeats 18+ times
