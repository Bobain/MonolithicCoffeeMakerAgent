# BUG-065: Orchestrator does not prioritize bugs over new development

**Status**: ✅ Resolved
**Priority**: Critical
**Created**: 2025-10-20T14:23:34.226555
**Reporter**: User
**Assigned**: code_developer

## Description

The orchestrator processes ROADMAP priorities sequentially without checking for open bugs. When the health monitor creates bug tickets (via BugTracker), the orchestrator does not detect or prioritize them. This means Critical/High priority bugs sit unaddressed while new feature development continues. The orchestrator should query for open bugs before each poll cycle and prioritize Critical/High bugs over new ROADMAP items.

## Reproduction Steps

1. Health monitor creates BUG-064 (High priority)
2. Orchestrator continues polling ROADMAP
3. Orchestrator spawns architect/code_developer for new features
4. BUG-064 remains unaddressed

## Expected Behavior
