# US-027: Real-Time Roadmap Updates for project_manager

**Status**: 📝 Planned
**Priority**: High
**Estimate**: 3-4 hours

## User Story
As a **project_manager**,
I always want **the roadmap branch to be up-to-date with code_developer's work**,
So that I can **look at ROADMAP.md updates and see real-time progress**.

## Problem
Currently, as project_manager:
- ❌ Can't see code_developer's progress until PR is merged
- ❌ ROADMAP.md updates are invisible during feature development
- ❌ No way to know what code_developer is working on right now
- ❌ Must ask code_developer "what's the status?" manually
- ❌ Can't provide early feedback on direction

**Impact**:
- Poor visibility into ongoing work
- Late discovery of issues
- Inefficient communication
- Can't plan effectively
- User feels disconnected from development

## Proposed Solution
Ensure roadmap branch always reflects latest progress through:
1. **Automatic syncing** from code_developer (US-024)
2. **Real-time notifications** when roadmap updates
3. **Dashboard view** showing last sync time and status
4. **Progress indicators** in ROADMAP.md always current

### Relationship to US-024

**US-024** (code_developer perspective): "I want to merge frequently"
**US-027** (project_manager perspective): "I want to see updates frequently"

These are **two sides of the same coin**:
- US-024 = push side (developer syncs work)
- US-027 = pull side (manager consumes updates)

---

## Technical Implementation

### Phase 1: Ensure Automatic Syncing (Depends on US-024)

Implement all US-024 requirements:
- [x] code_developer merges to roadmap after sub-tasks
- [x] code_developer merges after ROADMAP.md updates
- [x] code_developer merges before sleep/idle
- [x] Automatic conflict detection and handling

**Status**: US-024 provides the foundation.

### Phase 2: Visibility Enhancements for project_manager

#### 2.1 Roadmap Sync Status Dashboard

**File**: `coffee_maker/cli/roadmap_sync_status.py`

```python
"""Display roadmap synchronization status for project_manager."""

from datetime import datetime
from pathlib import Path
import subprocess
from rich.console import Console
from rich.table import Table

def show_roadmap_sync_status():
    """Show when roadmap branch was last updated and by what."""

    console = Console()

    # Get last commit on roadmap branch
    result = subprocess.run(
        ["git", "log", "origin/roadmap", "-1", "--format=%H|%an|%ar|%s"],
        capture_output=True,
        text=True
    )

    if result.returncode != 0:
        console.print("❌ Could not fetch roadmap status", style="red")
        return

    commit_hash, author, time_ago, message = result.stdout.strip().split('|', 3)

    # Get current feature branches
    branches_result = subprocess.run(
        ["git", "branch", "-r", "--list", "origin/feature/*"],
        capture_output=True,
        text=True
    )

    feature_branches = [
        b.strip().replace("origin/", "")
        for b in branches_result.stdout.strip().split('\n')
        if b.strip()
    ]

    # Check if any feature branches are ahead of roadmap
    ahead_branches = []
    for branch in feature_branches:
        ahead_result = subprocess.run(
            ["git", "rev-list", "--count", f"origin/roadmap..origin/{branch}"],
            capture_output=True,
            text=True
        )
        commits_ahead = int(ahead_result.stdout.strip())
        if commits_ahead > 0:
            ahead_branches.append((branch, commits_ahead))

    # Display status
    console.print("\n" + "=" * 80)
    console.print("📊 ROADMAP SYNC STATUS", style="bold cyan")
    console.print("=" * 80 + "\n")

    # Last update info
    table = Table(title="Last Roadmap Update")
    table.add_column("Property", style="cyan")
    table.add_column("Value", style="green")

    table.add_row("Last Updated", time_ago)
    table.add_row("Commit", commit_hash[:8])
    table.add_row("Author", author)
    table.add_row("Message", message)

    console.print(table)

    # Feature branches status
    if ahead_branches:
        console.print("\n⚠️  Feature branches with unsynced work:", style="yellow")
        for branch, commits in ahead_branches:
            console.print(f"  • {branch}: {commits} commit(s) ahead of roadmap")
        console.print("\n💡 Tip: These will be synced automatically by code_developer")
    else:
        console.print("\n✅ All feature branches are synced to roadmap!", style="green")

    # ROADMAP.md last modified
    roadmap_path = Path("docs/ROADMAP.md")
    if roadmap_path.exists():
        mod_time = datetime.fromtimestamp(roadmap_path.stat().st_mtime)
        time_since = datetime.now() - mod_time
        minutes = int(time_since.total_seconds() / 60)

        console.print(f"\n📝 ROADMAP.md last modified: {minutes} minute(s) ago")

    console.print("\n" + "=" * 80 + "\n")
```

#### 2.2 Add Command to project-manager CLI

**File**: `coffee_maker/cli/roadmap_cli.py` (add new command)

```python
def cmd_roadmap_status(args: argparse.Namespace) -> int:
    """Show roadmap synchronization status.

    Displays:
    - When roadmap branch was last updated
    - What feature branches are ahead of roadmap
    - How long since ROADMAP.md was modified

    Args:
        args: Parsed command-line arguments

    Returns:
        0 on success, 1 on error

    Example:
        $ project-manager roadmap-status
    """
    from coffee_maker.cli.roadmap_sync_status import show_roadmap_sync_status

    try:
        show_roadmap_sync_status()
        return 0
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"❌ Error showing roadmap status: {e}")
        return 1
```

**Usage**:
```bash
# Check roadmap sync status anytime
project-manager roadmap-status

# Output:
# ==========================================
# 📊 ROADMAP SYNC STATUS
# ==========================================
#
# Last Roadmap Update
# ┌──────────────┬─────────────────────────────────┐

# └──────────────┴─────────────────────────────────┘
#
# ✅ All feature branches are synced to roadmap!
#
# 📝 ROADMAP.md last modified: 2 minute(s) ago
```

#### 2.3 Automatic Notifications on Roadmap Updates

**File**: `coffee_maker/cli/roadmap_watcher.py`

```python
"""Watch roadmap branch for updates and notify project_manager."""

import subprocess
import time
from pathlib import Path

$ project-manager roadmap-status

# Output shows:
# - Roadmap updated 3 hours ago
# - code_developer merged US-024 implementation
# - All feature branches synced
# - ROADMAP.md modified 3 hours ago

# User is happy - knows exactly what's new! ✅
```

### Example 2: Continuous Monitoring

```bash
# User starts monitoring while working
$ project-manager watch-roadmap

# Terminal shows:
# 👀 Watching roadmap branch for updates...
#    Checking every 60 seconds
#    Press Ctrl+C to stop

# ... 5 minutes later ...

# 🔄 ROADMAP UPDATED
#
# Author: code_developer
# Time: just now
# Message: Merge feature/us-021: Complete File I/O migration

# 💡 View changes: git pull origin roadmap

# User sees update immediately! ✅
```

### Example 3: Quick Status Check

```bash
# User wonders if roadmap is current
$ project-manager roadmap-status

# Output shows:
# ⚠️  Feature branches with unsynced work:
#   • feature/us-021-refactoring-phase-1: 3 commits ahead
#
# 💡 Tip: These will be synced automatically by code_developer

# User knows code_developer has unsynced work, but it's expected ✅
```

---

## Success Metrics

After implementation:
- project_manager checks roadmap status 5+ times per day (easy access)
- 100% awareness of code_developer progress
- <5 minute delay from code_developer sync to project_manager awareness
- 0 "what's the status?" questions (self-service visibility)
- User satisfaction with progress transparency: 9/10+

---

## Integration with Existing Features

### Works With US-024
- **US-024** ensures roadmap is synced frequently
- **US-027** ensures project_manager can see those syncs
- Together they create a complete visibility loop

### Enhances Developer Status (PRIORITY 4)
- `developer-status` shows what code_developer is doing NOW
- `roadmap-status` shows what was synced to roadmap WHEN
- Complementary views of progress

### Supports PR Workflow (US-025, US-026)
- See when PR demo files are added
- Know when new bug issues are created
- Track PR progress through roadmap updates

---

## Technical Notes

### Git Commands Used
```bash
# Get last commit on roadmap
git log origin/roadmap -1 --format="%H|%an|%ar|%s"

# Check if feature branch is ahead
git rev-list --count origin/roadmap..origin/feature/us-021

# Fetch latest roadmap
git fetch origin roadmap

# Get file modification time
stat -f "%Sm" docs/ROADMAP.md
```

### Polling vs Webhooks
- **Polling** (implemented): Simple, works locally
- **Webhooks** (future): Real-time, requires GitHub App
- Start with polling, upgrade to webhooks if needed

### Notification Channels
- **Terminal**: Rich console output (default)
- **Desktop**: `notify-send` or `osascript` (optional)
- **Email**: SMTP for critical updates (optional)
- **Slack**: Webhook integration (optional)

## Related User Stories
- **US-024**: Frequent Roadmap Synchronization (code_developer side)
- **US-025**: PR Demo Files (helps project_manager test)
- **US-026**: Bug from PR Comments (tracks issues found by project_manager)
- **PRIORITY 4**: Developer Status Dashboard (real-time task status)

---

## Example: Real-World Usage

**Scenario**: User (project_manager) working on other tasks while code_developer is autonomous

**9:00 AM** - User starts terminal session
```bash
$ project-manager watch-roadmap &
# Watcher starts in background
```

**9:15 AM** - code_developer completes ConfigManager migration
```
🔄 ROADMAP UPDATED
Author: code_developer
Message: Merge feature/us-021: ConfigManager migration complete (15 files)
```

**10:30 AM** - code_developer completes File I/O utilities
```
🔄 ROADMAP UPDATED
Author: code_developer
Message: Merge feature/us-021: File I/O utilities migration complete (9 files)
```

**11:45 AM** - code_developer creates new user stories
```
🔄 ROADMAP UPDATED
Author: code_developer
Message: Merge feature/us-021: Create US-025 and US-026
```

**12:00 PM** - User checks overall status
```bash
$ project-manager roadmap-status

# Output shows all morning's updates
# User is fully informed without interrupting code_developer! ✅
```

---

## Questions for User Feedback

After implementation, ask user:
1. How often do you check `roadmap-status`?
2. Is the `watch-roadmap` feature useful or distracting?
3. What other information would help you track progress?
4. Should we add email/Slack notifications?
5. Is the update frequency (from US-024) appropriate?
