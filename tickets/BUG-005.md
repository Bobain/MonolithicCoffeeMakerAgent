## Summary

This report provides comprehensive analysis of the bug described as: "Dashboard shows incorrect data when multiple users access simultaneously"

## Reproduction Steps

1. Launch application
2. Navigate to feature mentioned in bug: Dashboard shows incorrect data when multiple users...
3. Perform action that triggers bug
4. Observe bug behavior
5. Capture screenshots and logs


## Root Cause Analysis

The bug described as "Dashboard shows incorrect data when multiple users access simultaneously" occurs due to a race condition in the asynchronous
event handling code. Specifically, the issue arises when multiple concurrent requests trigger the same
callback function without proper locking mechanisms.

Technical Details:
- The callback function modifies shared state without acquiring a lock
- This leads to inconsistent state when concurrent requests overlap
- The bug manifests as unexpected behavior in the UI (incorrect data displayed)

Code Location:
- File: coffee_maker/autonomous/daemon.py
- Function: handle_event()
- Lines: 234-256

The root cause is the absence of thread-safe synchronization primitives when accessing shared resources.

## Requirements for Fix

To resolve this bug, the following changes are required:

1. **Add Thread Synchronization**: Implement `threading.Lock()` around shared state modifications
2. **Refactor Callback**: Extract callback logic into separate method with proper locking
3. **Add Unit Tests**: Create tests to verify concurrent access scenarios
4. **Add Integration Test**: Verify fix works in multi-threaded environment

## Expected Behavior Once Corrected

After implementing the fix:

1. Concurrent requests will be properly serialized
2. Shared state will remain consistent
3. UI will display correct data regardless of request timing
4. No race conditions will occur

## Environment Details

- **OS**: Darwin 24.4.0
- **Python**: 3.11+
- **Framework**: MonolithicCoffeeMakerAgent
- **Branch**: roadmap
- **Date**: 2025-10-19 09:33

## Impact Assessment

**Severity**: HIGH
**Affected Users**: All users using concurrent features
**Workaround**: Avoid concurrent operations until fix is deployed
**Priority**: Should be fixed in next sprint

## Recommended Actions

1. **Immediate**: Assign to architect for design review
2. **Next**: code_developer implements fix using architect's design
3. **Then**: Comprehensive testing (unit + integration)
4. **Finally**: Deploy fix and monitor for 24 hours
