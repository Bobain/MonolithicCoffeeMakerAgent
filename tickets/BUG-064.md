# BUG-064: architect analyze-codebase requires interactive input

**Status**: ✅ Resolved
**Priority**: High
**Created**: 2025-10-20T14:19:28.345069

**Assigned**: code_developer

## Description

The orchestrator spawns architect with analyze-codebase command, but this command requires interactive user input (Perform analysis anyway? [y/N]:). This causes agents to abort immediately. Need to add --force or --yes flag to analyze-codebase for autonomous operation.

## Reproduction Steps

1. Run: poetry run architect analyze-codebase
2. Observe prompt: Perform analysis anyway? [y/N]:
3. Command aborts without user input

## Expected Behavior

_To be determined during analysis_

## Actual Behavior

_To be determined during analysis_
