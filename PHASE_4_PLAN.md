# Phase 4: Integration and Refinement Plan

**Status**: In Progress
**Started**: 2025-10-27
**Target**: Production-ready consolidated command architecture

---

## Overview

Phase 4 focuses on integrating the consolidated command architecture into the existing agent implementations and refining the system for production use.

## Objectives

1. **Agent Integration**: Update all agent implementations to use consolidated commands
2. **Documentation Refinement**: Polish API docs and migration guides
3. **Test Coverage**: Increase from 90% to >95% pass rate
4. **Performance Validation**: Ensure no performance regression
5. **Production Readiness**: Final polish and validation

## Phase 4 Tasks

### 1. Agent Integration (Priority: HIGH)

**Update agent implementations to use new consolidated commands**

#### 1.1 Update code_developer Agent
- [ ] Replace legacy command calls with consolidated commands
- [ ] Update daemon integration
- [ ] Validate autonomous operation
- [ ] File: `coffee_maker/autonomous/code_developer_agent.py`

#### 1.2 Update project_manager CLI
- [ ] Replace command calls in CLI
- [ ] Update interactive mode
- [ ] Validate chat interface
- [ ] File: `coffee_maker/cli/project_manager_cli.py`

#### 1.3 Update architect Agent
- [ ] Replace specification management calls
- [ ] Update task decomposition
- [ ] Validate workflow integration
- [ ] File: `.claude/agents/architect.md` prompts

#### 1.4 Update code_reviewer Agent
- [ ] Replace review command calls
- [ ] Update notification system
- [ ] Validate integration with architect
- [ ] File: `.claude/agents/code_reviewer.md` prompts

#### 1.5 Update orchestrator
- [ ] Replace agent lifecycle commands
- [ ] Update worktree management
- [ ] Validate parallel execution
- [ ] File: `coffee_maker/autonomous/orchestrator.py`

### 2. Remaining Test Fixes (Priority: MEDIUM)

**Fix remaining 26 test failures**

- [ ] Orchestrator tests (~10 failures)
  - Parameter name mismatches (message → content, etc.)
  - Return type expectations
- [ ] User Listener tests (~10 failures)
  - Parameter name mismatches (context_data → context, etc.)
  - Optional parameter handling
- [ ] UX Design tests (~6 failures)
  - Parameter name mismatches (item_id → debt_id, etc.)
  - Return type expectations

### 3. Documentation Refinement (Priority: MEDIUM)

- [ ] Update API reference with actual return types
- [ ] Add more usage examples for each command
- [ ] Create video/GIF demos of key workflows
- [ ] Update CLAUDE.md with consolidated command info
- [ ] Create cheat sheet for quick reference

### 4. Performance Validation (Priority: MEDIUM)

- [ ] Benchmark command execution times
- [ ] Compare with legacy command performance
- [ ] Validate no regression in daemon speed
- [ ] Document performance characteristics

### 5. Production Checklist (Priority: HIGH)

- [ ] All tests passing (>95%)
- [ ] CI/CD green
- [ ] Documentation complete
- [ ] Migration guide tested
- [ ] Backward compatibility verified
- [ ] Performance validated
- [ ] Security review completed
- [ ] Ready for production deployment

## Success Criteria

1. ✅ All agent types successfully using consolidated commands
2. ✅ Test suite at >95% pass rate
3. ✅ CI/CD pipeline green
4. ✅ Documentation complete and reviewed
5. ✅ No performance regression
6. ✅ Backward compatibility validated
7. ✅ Production deployment successful

---

## Timeline

- **Week 1**: Agent integration + remaining test fixes
- **Week 2**: Documentation + performance validation + production readiness

**Total Estimated Time**: 2 weeks

---

## Current Progress

### Completed (Phases 1-3)
- ✅ 36 consolidated commands implemented
- ✅ Backward compatibility layer
- ✅ 258 unit tests (90% passing)
- ✅ Comprehensive documentation
- ✅ Migration framework

### In Progress (Phase 4)
- ⏳ Agent integration
- ⏳ Final test fixes
- ⏳ Documentation refinement

### Pending
- ⏸️ Performance validation
- ⏸️ Production deployment

---

## Notes

- User requested to "keep going with phase 4" - prioritize integration work
- CI is currently running for PR #143
- 90% test pass rate is solid foundation
- Remaining test failures are mostly parameter naming consistency issues
- Focus on high-value integration work first
